{\ttfamily kdb spec-\/mount \mbox{[}/$<$mountpoint$>$\mbox{]} \mbox{[}$<$plugin$>$ \mbox{[}$<$config$>$\mbox{]} \mbox{[}..\mbox{]}\mbox{]}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily mountpoint} is where in the key database the new backend should be mounted to. It must be a cascading mountpoint, i.\+e., {\ttfamily mountpoint} must start with {\ttfamily /}.
\item {\ttfamily plugin} are extra Elektra plugins to be used (next to the one specified in {\ttfamily spec/}).
\item Plugins may be followed by a {\ttfamily ,} separated list of {\ttfamily keys=values} pairs which will be used as plugin configuration.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily kdb smount} is an alias and can be used in the same way as {\ttfamily kdb spec-\/mount}.

\subsection*{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+ON}

This command allows a user to mount a new {\itshape backend} described by a previously mounted specification. To mount a specification file to {\ttfamily spec}-\/\hyperlink{md_doc_help_elektra-namespaces_doc_help_elektra-namespaces_md}{namespace} first use \hyperlink{md_doc_help_kdb-mount_doc_help_kdb-mount_md}{kdb-\/mount(7)}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    kdb mount some-spec-file.ini spec/example/mountpoint ni
\end{DoxyVerb}


The idea of mounting is explained \hyperlink{md_doc_help_elektra-mounting_doc_help_elektra-mounting_md}{in elektra-\/mounting(7)}. The {\ttfamily spec} \hyperlink{md_doc_help_elektra-namespaces_doc_help_elektra-namespaces_md}{namespace} contains metaconfiguration that describes the configuration in all other namespaces. The metadata used for the specification is described in \href{/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/doc/METADATA.ini}{\tt M\+E\+T\+A\+D\+A\+T\+A.\+ini}.

During {\ttfamily spec-\/mount} the {\ttfamily spec} keys are searched for relevant metadata\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For every metadata {\ttfamily mountpoint} an additional cascading mountpoint will be mounted.
\item The {\ttfamily infos/$\ast$} and {\ttfamily config/needs} from \href{/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/doc/CONTRACT.ini}{\tt C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+A\+C\+T.\+ini}, that are tagged by {\ttfamily usedby = spec}, will work as described there.
\item For other metadata suitable plugins are searched and mounted additionally.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    kdb getmeta spec/example/mountpoint mountpoint  # verify that we have a mountpoint here
    kdb spec-mount /example/mountpoint  # mounts /example/mountpoint according to specification
            # found at spec/example/mountpoint
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+NT}

This command writes into the {\ttfamily /etc} directory and as such it requires root permissions. Use {\ttfamily kdb file system/elektra/mountpoints} to find out where exactly it will write to.

Note that many specifications have globs like {\ttfamily \+\_\+} and {\ttfamily \#}. They will only work if the {\ttfamily spec} plugin is present\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    kdb global-mount
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item {\ttfamily -\/R}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/resolver $<$resolver$>$}\+: Specify the resolver plugin to use if no resolver is given, the default resolver is used. See also \href{#KDB}{\tt below in K\+DB}. Note that the resolver will only added as dependency, but not directly added.
\item {\ttfamily -\/c}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/plugins-\/config $<$plugins-\/config$>$}\+: Add a plugin configuration for all plugins.
\item {\ttfamily -\/W}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/with-\/recommends}\+: Also add recommended plugins and warn if they are not available.
