doc_dev_plugins-ordering_md \- Plugins Ordering 
You should first read \fBelektra-plugins\fP to get an idea about plugins\&.
.PP
This document describes how \fBelektra-plugins\fP are ordered with \fBelektra-backends(7)\fP\&.
.PP
Multiple plugins open up many ways in which they can be arranged\&. A simple way is to have one array with pointers to plugins\&. To store a \fCKeySet\fP, the first plugin starts off with the \fCKeySet\fP passed to it\&. The resulting \fCKeySet\fP is given to the next plugin\&. This is repeated for every plugin in the array\&.
.PP
To obtain a \fCKeySet\fP, the array of plugins is processed the other way round\&. An empty \fCKeySet\fP is passed to the last plugin\&. The resulting \fCKeySet\fP is handed over to the previous one until the first plugin is executed\&.
.PP
This approach has shown not to be powerful enough to express all use cases by counter-evidence\&. Logging should take place after the storage plugin performs its actions in both directions\&. It is not possible to do this with a \fIsingle array\fP processed in a way as described above\&.
.SH "Separated lists"
.PP
Two individual lists (get+set list) of plugins solve the described problem\&. Instead of bidirectional processing of a single list two separate arrays are used\&. It turns out that error scenarios also make this approach unsuccessful\&. When a plugin fails, no other plugin must be executed later on because it might depend on the previous plugin to work correctly\&. In \fC\fBkdbGet()\fP\fP, this works well -- the update process will be stopped\&. But during \fC\fBkdbSet()\fP\fP, changes to the file system must be reverted\&. Plugins can leave a lock, temporary file or journal\&. These resources need to be cleaned up properly\&.
.SH "Error List"
.PP
So every backend additionally needs a third array that is executed in error scenarios during \fC\fBkdbSet()\fP\fP\&. Plugins responsible for the cleanup, rollback or error notification are inserted into it\&.
.PP
The resolver plugin requires this error list to do a proper rollback\&. Another use case is logging after a failure has happened\&.
.SH "Placements"
.PP
The ordering of plugins inside these three arrays is controlled by \fBelektra-contracts(7)\fP\&. Each of the three arrays has ten slots\&. These slots have names to be referred to in the contract\&.
.PP
Here you see a table that contains all names:
.PP
Slot Error Get Set  0 prerollback getresolver setresolver  1 prerollback pregetstorage presetstorage  2 prerollback pregetstorage presetstorage  3 prerollback pregetstorage presetstorage  4 prerollback pregetstorage presetstorage  5 rollback getstorage setstorage  6 postrollback postgetstorage precommit  7 postrollback postgetstorage commit  8 postrollback postgetstorage postcommit  9 postrollback postgetstorage postcommit  
.PP
\&. How the placement is influenced using \fCinfos/placement\fP, \fCinfos/ordering\fP and \fCinfos/stacking\fP is described in \fCCONTRACT\&.ini\fP\&.
