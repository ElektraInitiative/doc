.PP
.PP
This plugin can be used to perform rename operations on keys\&. This is useful if a backend does not provide keys with the required names or case\&.
.PP
If keys are renamed, their original name is stored in the \fCorigname\fP MetaKey\&.
.PP
.SS "CUT"
.PP
.SS "OPERATION"
.PP
The cut operation can be used to strip parts of a keys name\&. The cut operation is able to cut anything below the path of the parent key\&. A renamed key may even replace the parent key\&. For example consider a KeySet with the parent key \fCuser/config\fP\&. If the KeySet contained a key with the name \fCuser/config/with/long/path/key1\fP, the cut operation would be able to strip the following key name parts:
.IP "\(bu" 2
with
.IP "\(bu" 2
with/long
.IP "\(bu" 2
with/long/path
.IP "\(bu" 2
with/long/path/key1
.PP
.PP
.SS "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The cut operation takes as its only configuration parameter the key name part to strip\&. This configuration can be supplied in two different ways\&. First, the global configuration key \fCcut\fP can be used\&. Second, keys to be stripped can be tagged with the MetaKey \fCrename/cut\fP\&. If both options are given, the MetaKey takes precedence\&. For example, consider the following setup: 
.PP
.nf
                            `config/cut` = will/be
                            parent key = user/config

                            user/config/will/be/stripped/key1                       <- meta rename/cut = will/be/stripped
                            user/config/will/be/stripped/key2                       <- meta rename/cut = will/be/stripped
                            user/config/will/be/stripped/key3
                            user/config/will/not/be/stripped/key4

.fi
.PP
.PP
The result of the cut operation would be the following KeySet: 
.PP
.nf
                            user/config/key1
                            user/config/key2
                            user/config/stripped/key3
                            user/config/will/not/be/stripped/key4

.fi
.PP
.PP
The cut operation is agnostic to a single trailing slash in the configuration\&. This means that it makes no difference whether \fCcut = will/be/stripped\fP or \fCcut = will/be/stripped/\fP\&. However, the cut operation refuses cut paths with leading slash\&. This is to clarify that key name parts can only be stripped after the parent key path\&.
.PP
If an invalid configuration is given or the cut operation would cause a parent key duplicate, the affected keys are simply skipped and not renamed\&.
.PP
.SS "REPLACE"
.PP
Using the \fC/replacewith\fP global key or \fCrename/to\fP MetaKey the rename plugin will replace the part removed by \fCcut\fP with the supplied String
.PP
.SS "TO UPPER / LOWER"
.PP
Using the \fC/toupper\fP or \fC/tolower\fP global configuration key, or the \fCrename/toupper\fP or \fCrename/tolower\fP metakey the rename plugin will convert the keynames to uppercase or lowercase\&. The supplied values tell the plugin how many levels starting from the right will be converted\&. \fCtoupper\fP and \fCtolower\fP can be combined\&. When no value or '0' is supplied with the keys the whole name below the parentkey will be converted\&.
.PP
The toupper/tolower conversions are applied after cut/replace\&.
.PP
Note that the names refer to the representation as KeySet\&. For example, if you have a configuration file where every name is uppercase: ``` KEY=value OTHER/KEY=otherval ``\fC you can use\fPtolower=0\fCto get the keys\fPkey\fCand\fPother/key`\&.
.PP
.SS "EXAMPLE"
.PP
``` kdb mount caseconversion\&.ini /rename ini rename toupper=1,tolower=3
.PP
kdb set /rename/MIXED/CASE/conversion 1
.PP
kdb ls /rename user/rename user/rename/mixed/case/CONVERSION ```
.PP
.SS "PLANNED OPERATIONS"
.PP
Additional rename operations are planned for future versions of the rename plugin:
.IP "\(bu" 2
trim: remove spaces in the name (that are not part of parentKey)
.IP "\(bu" 2
ranges for toupper, tolower
.IP "\(bu" 2
allow one to specify the case in configuration files (#485)
