{\ttfamily kdb validate}\hypertarget{doc_help_kdb-validate_md_autotoc_md2713}{}\doxysection{DESCRIPTION}\label{doc_help_kdb-validate_md_autotoc_md2713}
Validate the values of string keys below a given name using the loaded validation plugins (eg. range or validation) by reading all values, making them dirty by changing to another value, changing back to original and then writing that back to the key database.

This command is useful for validating configuration files against their specifications.

For keys to be validated, they must contain the \textquotesingle{}check\textquotesingle{}-\/metakeys and the respective plugins for validation must be loaded for the backend that was used while mounting. If a validation is done while using {\ttfamily kdb set} or {\ttfamily kdb get} the same validation is also done by {\ttfamily kdb validate} Only string keys are validated! Binary keys are skipped!

Use {\ttfamily -\/f} to do a write-\/test even if the previous read from the key database has issued warnings.\hypertarget{doc_help_kdb-validate_md_autotoc_md2714}{}\doxysection{OPTIONS}\label{doc_help_kdb-validate_md_autotoc_md2714}
