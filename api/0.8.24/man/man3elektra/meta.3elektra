.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Meta data proposal+compatibility methods\&. 

In versions before Elektra 0\&.8 only limited metadata was available\&. Now any metadata can be added\&. These API methods are implementations of the 0\&.7 API using 0\&.8 metadata\&.
.PP
Additionally, new suggestions can be made here\&.
.PP
It is planned that these methods will be generated from doc/METADATA\&.ini and moved to a separate library\&. Currently, you should better avoid the methods and directly use \fBmetainfo \fP instead\&.

.SS "int elektraKeyCmpOrder (const Key * ka, const Key * kb)"

.PP
Compare the order metadata of two keys\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
a number less than, equal to or greater than zero if the order of k1 is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the order of k2\&. If one key is NULL, but the other isn't, the key which is not NULL is considered to be greater\&. If both keys are NULL, they are considered to be equal\&. If one key does have an order metadata but the other has not, the key with the metadata is considered greater\&. If no key has metadata, they are considered to be equal\&.

.SS "void elektraMetaArrayAdd (Key * key, const char * metaName, const char * value)"

.PP
creates an metadata array or appends another element to an existing metadata array e\&.g\&. Key *key = keyNew('user/test', KEY_END); elektraMetaArrayAdd(key, 'test', 'val0'); key now has 'test/#0' with value 'val0' as metadata elektraMetaArrayAdd(key, 'test', 'val1'); appends 'test/#1' with value 'val1' to key
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIkey\fP the key the metadata should be added to 
.br
\fImetaName\fP the name of the metakey array parent 
.br
\fIvalue\fP the value of the newly appended metakey 
.RE
.PP

.SS "KeySet* elektraMetaArrayToKS (Key * key, const char * metaName)"

.PP
Create a \fCKeySet\fP from a metakey array\&. For example, the following function call
.PP
.PP
.nf
elektraMetaArrayToKS(
        keyNew ("/a", KEY_VALUE, "b, c",

.fi
.PP
.PP
returns a \fCKeySet\fP containing the keys \fC'dep/#0'\fP with value \fC'/b'\fP and \fC'dep/#1'\fP with value \fC'/c'\fP\&.
.PP
If no meta key array is found, null is returned\&. The returned \fCKeySet\fP must be freed with \fCksDel\fP
.PP

\fImetaName\fP the name of the metakey array parent

.SS "int elektraSortTopology (KeySet * ks, Key ** array)"

.PP
topological sorting 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIarray\fP the array where the sorted keys will be stored in topological order\&. Nothing will be written into an array if 
.br
\fIks\fP is the keyset that should be sorted\&. Dependencies and order is defined by metakeys\&.
.RE
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
the 'dep/#' metakeys e\&.g\&. the Key *k = keyNew ('/a', KEY_VALUE, 'b, c', KEY_META, 'dep', '#1', KEY_META, 'dep/#0', '/b', KEY_META, 'dep/#1', '/c', KEY_END), 'dep'); depends on Key '/b' and Key '/c'\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
if 'order' metakeys are defined for the keys the algorithm tries to resolves them by that order using lexical comparison\&. You should prefer \fC#0\fP array syntax\&.
.PP
.PP
Duplicated and reflexive dep entries are ignored\&.
.PP
The algorithm used is a mixture of Kahn and BFS\&. Furthermore the algorithm does not use recursion\&.
.PP
First a BFS with the keys sorted by 'order' is used\&. Then all dependencies (recursively) of every key is collected\&.
.PP
\fBReturn values:\fP

\fI0\fP for cycles

\fI-1\fP for invalid dependencies

.PP

.SS "const char* keyComment (const Key * key)"

.PP
Return a pointer to the real internal \fCkey\fP comment\&. This is a much more efficient version of \fBkeyGetComment()\fP and you should use it if you are responsible enough to not mess up things\&. You are not allowed to change anything in the memory region the returned pointer points to\&.
.PP
\fBkeyComment()\fP returns '' when there is no keyComment\&. The reason is 
.PP
.nf

keySetComment(key,"");
keyComment(key); // you would expect "" here
keyDel(key);

.fi
.PP
.PP
See \fBkeySetComment()\fP for more information on comments\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Note that the Key structure keeps its own size field that is calculated by library internal calls, so to avoid inconsistencies, you must never use the pointer returned by \fBkeyComment()\fP method to set a new value\&. Use \fBkeySetComment()\fP instead\&.

Every \fBkdbGet()\fP might update the access time of a key\&. You get information when the key was read the last time from the database\&.

Beware that multiple copies of keys with \fBkeyDup()\fP might have different atimes because you \fBkdbGet()\fP one, but not the other\&. You can use this information to decide which key is the latest\&.

Get the key comment\&. 
.SH "Comments"
.PP
A Key comment is description for humans what this key is for\&. It may be a textual explanation of valid values, when and why a user or administrator changed the key or any other text that helps the user or administrator related to that key\&.
.PP
Don't depend on a comment in your program\&. A user is always allowed to remove or change it in any way he wants to\&. But you are allowed or even encouraged to always show the content of the comment to the user and allow him to change it\&.

The mode consists of 9 individual bits for mode permissions\&. In the following explanation the octal notation with leading zero will be used\&.

Default is 0664 (octal) for keys and 0775 for directory keys which used \fBkeySetDir()\fP\&.

.PP
\fBNote:\fP

.RE
.PP
.SH "Modes"
.PP
0000 is the most restrictive mode\&. No user might read, write or execute the key\&.
.PP
Reading the key means to get the value by \fBkdbGet()\fP\&.
.PP
Writing the key means to set the value by \fBkdbSet()\fP\&.
.PP
Execute the key means to make a step deeper in the hierarchy\&. But you must be able to read the key to be able to list the keys below\&. See also \fBkeySetDir()\fP in that context\&. But you must be able to write the key to be able to add or remove keys below\&.
.PP
0777 is the most relaxing mode\&. Every user is allowed to read, write and execute the key, if he is allowed to execute and read all keys below\&.
.PP
0700 allows every action for the current user, identified by the uid\&. See \fBkeyGetUID()\fP and \fBkeySetUID()\fP\&.
.PP
To be more specific for the user the single bits can elect the mode for read, write and execute\&. 0100 only allows executing which gives the information that it is a directory for that user, but not accessible\&. 0200 only allows reading\&. This information may be combined to 0300, which allows execute and reading of the directory\&. Last 0400 decides about the writing permissions\&.
.PP
The same as above is also valid for the 2 other octal digits\&. 0070 decides about the group permissions, in that case full access\&. Groups are identified by the gid\&. See \fBkeyGetGID()\fP and \fBkeySetGID()\fP\&. In that example everyone with a different uid, but the gid of the the key, has full access\&.
.PP
0007 decides about the world permissions\&. This is taken into account when neither the uid nor the gid matches\&. So that example would allow everyone with a different uid and gid of that key gains full access\&.
