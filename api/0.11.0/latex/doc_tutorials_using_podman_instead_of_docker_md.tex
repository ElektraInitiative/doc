 Podman is an alternative container engine which does not require root privileges on the host OS.

Podman aims at being compatible with Docker and in most cases simply replacing {\ttfamily docker} by {\ttfamily podman} is enough.

However, there are some notable differences when running containers themselves as a user other than root.\hypertarget{doc_tutorials_using_podman_instead_of_docker_md_autotoc_md4721}{}\doxysection{Who Is This Guide For?}\label{doc_tutorials_using_podman_instead_of_docker_md_autotoc_md4721}

To build the Debian bullseye container with Docker the command is


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{docker build \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{  -\/-\/tag "{}build-\/elektra-\/debian-\/bullseye"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/-\/build-\/arg "{}JENKINS\_USERID=\$(id -\/u)"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/-\/build-\/arg "{}JENKINS\_GROUPID=\$(id -\/g)"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/-\/file "{}scripts/docker/debian/bullseye/Dockerfile"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{        scripts/docker/debian/bullseye/}

\end{DoxyCode}


Simply replacing {\ttfamily docker} with {\ttfamily podman} works in this case


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{podman build \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{  -\/-\/tag "{}build-\/elektra-\/debian-\/bullseye"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/-\/build-\/arg "{}JENKINS\_USERID=\$(id -\/u)"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/-\/build-\/arg "{}JENKINS\_GROUPID=\$(id -\/g)"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{        -\/-\/file "{}scripts/docker/debian/bullseye/Dockerfile"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{        scripts/docker/debian/bullseye/}

\end{DoxyCode}

One area where Podman notably differs from Docker is when interacting with the filesystem of the host.

This is relevant when mounting directories of the host filesystem as volumes.

With Docker the container engine itself runs as a priviledged process and therefore the permissions in the host OS are not relevant.

With Podman the situation is more involved, as the container engine does not run with root priviledges.

For instance, the containers specified for building Elektra are configured such that the user inside the container is a non-\/root user.

If one wishes to mount the Elektra source directory from the host filesystem as a volume for the container, extra steps are necessary.

Inside the source directory, you can change the permissions to any user id with {\ttfamily podman unshare chown \$(id -\/u)\+:\$(id -\/u) -\/R .}. Keep in mind that this changes the {\itshape host} filesystem. You can read more about this \href{https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html}{\texttt{ here}}.

After having changed the permissions, one can run the container


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{podman run \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/-\/user \$(id -\/u) \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/-\/interactive \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/-\/tty \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/-\/rm \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/-\/volume "{}\$PWD:/home/jenkins/workspace:Z"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   -\/-\/workdir "{}/home/jenkins/workspace"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   build-\/elektra-\/debian-\/bullseye}

\end{DoxyCode}


Do not forget the {\ttfamily \+:Z} label. You can read more about the labels in the Podman \href{https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html\#volume-v-source-volume-host-dir-containe}{\texttt{ documentation}}.

Alternatively, if you prefer to not change the permissions of the host filesystem, you can run the container as a root user. Note however, that the environment will differ from that used in continuous integration and the usual caveats concerning running processes as root apply\+:
