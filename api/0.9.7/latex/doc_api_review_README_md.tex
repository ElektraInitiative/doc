This review is performed for each function separately. Each function should be evaluated according to the checklist. The reviewer judges for every bullet point, whether the function does / does not fulfill the bullet point. For every unfulfilled point a short explanation has to be given why the reviewer thinks the function does not fulfill the respective bullet point. This is done simply by providing a short description of the issue below the respective bullet point. After the review has been completed, the reviewer creates an issue for every unfulfilled bullet point so it can be fixed by the Elektra Initiative.\hypertarget{doc_api_review_README_md_autotoc_md1521}{}\doxysection{Checklist Legend}\label{doc_api_review_README_md_autotoc_md1521}
