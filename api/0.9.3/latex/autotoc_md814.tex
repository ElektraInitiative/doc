The following representation standards of units are currently supported and can be used by setting {\ttfamily check/unit}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily $<$numeric value$>$$<$one or more spaces$>$$<$memory unit$>$}

e.\+g. 20 MB, 256 KB
\end{DoxyItemize}

The following representation standards of units are currently supported and can be use by setting {\ttfamily check/unit} to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily $<$numeric value$>$$<$one or more spaces$>$$<$memory unit$>$}

e.\+g. 20 MB, 256 KB, the value then will be normalized to bytes
\end{DoxyItemize}

e.\+g. 20 KB will become 20000 Bytes

Only basic units are supported (everthing from Bytes to Petabytes, but no KiB, MiB or Gib) The max value is limited by the capacity of unsigned Longs. Using greater values will result in an error.
