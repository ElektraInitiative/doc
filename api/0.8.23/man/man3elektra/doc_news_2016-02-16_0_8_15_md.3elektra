shortDesc: adds improved mounting, split of library & configuration validation
.PP
.PP
In case you do not yet know about it, here is an abstract about Elektra:
.PP
Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration parameters in a global, hierarchical key database\&. Elektra provides a mature, consistent and easily comprehensible API\&. Its modularity effectively avoids code duplication across applications and tools regarding configuration tasks\&. Elektra abstracts from cross-platform-related issues and allows applications to be aware of other applications' configurations, leveraging easy application integration\&.
.PP
See \fChttps://libelektra\&.org\fP
.PP
.SS "Overview"
.PP
This is one of the largest release up to now\&. It includes many user-visible improvements\&. Some highlights:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Mounting is vastly improved: think about Debian's 'dpkg' to 'apt'-like functionality
.IP "\(bu" 2
In previous releases you could already specify the structure of the configuration\&. Now you can also automatically enforce this property\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
We split the shared library \fClibelektra\fP into smaller parts\&. Now users can link against the parts of the library they need\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
As always, the ABI and API is fully forward-compatible\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The release contains improvements in the \fBhttps:\fP//github\&.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/doc/decisions/bootstrap\&.md 'bootstrapping process'\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
We improved the \fCini\fP, \fCrename\fP and \fCcrypto\fP plugins\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The tool \fCkdb\fP now supports bookmarks and profiles\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The new tool \fCkdb editor\fP allows you to edit KDB configuration in your favorite text editor\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
We are glad of the new packages for Debian, Arch Linux and OpenWRT\&.
.PP
.PP
The same text as follows is also available \fChere as html\fP and \fBhttps:\fP//github\&.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/doc/news/2016-02-16_0\&.8\&.15\&.md 'here on github'
.PP
.SS "Global Mount"
.PP
Sometimes you simply want some functionality for the whole key database\&. For example, you want to enable logging or notification of configuration changes\&. In previous versions, you had to change every mountpoint individually\&. Even more problematic, every mountpoint created its individual logs and notifications, without any way for someone to know if an application has issued its last log/notification\&.
.PP
These problems are now solved by global plugins\&. The same plugins are reused for this purpose\&. Also the mounting works nearly in the same way, you only have to omit the configuration file and the mountpoint: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb global-mount syslog journald dbus

.fi
.PP
.PP
VoilÃ , from now on every configuration change gets logged to syslog and journald\&. Additionally, every application gets notified via dbus\&.
.PP
If you want it more verbose for debugging, you can easily do so by: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb global-mount logchange counter

.fi
.PP
.PP
Which gives you detailed information to standard output which keys were changed/edited/deleted\&. Additionally, Elektra counts how often the \fCcounter\fP plugin is invoked\&.
.PP
The underlying work for the global plugins, i\&.e\&. hooks in the core libraries and the \fClist\fP plugin that allows us to use many plugins without bloating the core was done by Thomas Waser\&.
.PP
It was already possible in earlier versions of Elektra to specify the configuration of your program\&. Until now, this specification could be mainly used to to generate code as described \fChere\fP\&. This release adds two more interesting options:
.PP
.IP "1." 4
the spec plugin, and
.IP "2." 4
the spec mount\&.
.PP
.PP
.SS "Spec Plugin"
.PP
The most important global plugin that is now newly introduced with this release (thanks to Thomas Waser) is the \fCspec\fP plugin\&. By default it will be added for every global-mount\&. So for a new installation make sure you executed at least once: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb global-mount

.fi
.PP
.PP
The spec plugin is a global plugin that copies metadata from the \fCspec\fP-namespace to other namespaces\&. That means, it reads the specification, and makes sure that the configuration conforms to it\&. The actual validation is done by the many validation plugins already present\&.
.PP
Lets start by saying a key is a long and must have at least the value 10: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb setmeta spec/example/longkey check/type long

.fi
.PP
.PP
Then we can create a key in a different namespace and see if the \fCspec\fP plugin applies the metadata correctly: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb set /example/longkey 25
    kdb lsmeta /example/longkey

.fi
.PP
.PP
Should now at least print \fCcheck/type\fP\&. By itself, this is useful for documentation of keys\&. For example, the application developer says: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb setmeta spec/example/longkey description "Do not change"
    kdb setmeta spec/example/longkey example 30

.fi
.PP
.PP
The user can retrieve this documentation by: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb getmeta /example/longkey description

.fi
.PP
.PP
But we want \fCcheck/type\fP to be not only a documentation, but also enforced\&.
.PP
.SS "Spec Mount"
.PP
Using \fCkdb setmeta\fP extensively and always looking out that all plugins are mounted correctly is error-prone\&. So instead, one can directly mount the plugins as specified\&. For the example above one simply needs: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb setmeta spec/example mountpoint example.ecf
    kdb spec-mount /example

.fi
.PP
.PP
Now, when we try to modify \fC/example/longkey\fP it will be validated: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb set /example/longkey a
    > Error (#52) [...] long [not] matched [...] a

.fi
.PP
.PP
Based on the present metadata, the correct plugins (in this case \fCtype\fP because of the metadata \fCcheck/type\fP) will be loaded\&.
.PP
We can also create a whole specification file, first mount the specification and then the mountpoint according the specification, e\&.g when we have \fCbattery\&.ini\fP in the folder \fC$(dirname $(kdb file spec))\fP with following content: 
.PP
.nf
    []
    mountpoint = battery.ini
    infos/plugins = ini

    [level]
    check/enum = 'critical', 'low', 'high', 'full'

.fi
.PP
.PP
Then we can use: 
.PP
.nf
    # mount the file itself:
    kdb mount battery.ini spec/example/battery ni
    # make sure all plugins are present (e.g. enum for check/enum):
    kdb spec-mount /example/battery

.fi
.PP
.PP
Now lets verify if it worked: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb lsmeta /example/battery/level
    # we see it has a check/enum
    kdb getmeta /example/battery/level check/enum
    # now we know allowed values
    kdb set /example/battery/level low
    # success, low is ok!
    kdb set /example/battery/level wrong
    # fails, not one of the allowed values!

.fi
.PP
.PP
The main idea of the spec-mount is: search a plugin for every specification (metadata) found in the spec-namespace\&.
.PP
.SS "General Mount Improvements"
.PP
In earlier versions \fCkdb mount\fP failed when plugin dependencies were not satisfied\&. Now dependencies will automatically be fulfilled, e\&.g\&. 
.PP
.nf
    kdb mount /etc/modules system/modules line

.fi
.PP
.PP
In earlier versions you would have got an error because of the missing \fCnull\fP plugin\&. Now it simply adds the needed plugins\&.
.PP
The plugins given in the command-line used to be real plugins\&. Now also so called providers are accepted\&.
.PP
To make providers useful we need to actually know which plugin is the best candidate\&. To get the information we added a \fCinfos/status\fP clause in the contract\&. In this clause the plugin developer adds many details how well the plugin is tested, reviewed, documented, maintained and so on\&. Based on this information, the best suited plugin will be chosen\&. For example, you now can use: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb mount /etc/security/limits.conf system/limits augeas \
            lens=Limits.lns logging

.fi
.PP
.PP
And the best suitable logger will automatically be chosen\&.
.PP
The configuration variable \fC/sw/kdb/current/plugins\fP now allows us to pass plugin configuration with the same syntax as the plugin specification passed on the commandline\&. A subtle difference is that thus the shell-splitting of arguments is missing, it is not possible to include whitespaces in the plugin configuration that way\&.
.PP
Now it is also possible to include the same plugin multiple times and also give them individual names\&. This feature is essential for script-based plugins, e\&.g\&. you now might add: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb mount file.x /example/mountpoint \
            lua#resolver script=resolver.lua \
            lua#storage script=storage.lua

.fi
.PP
.PP
Furthermore, \fCkdb mount\fP now supports recommendations, which can be enabled with \fC--with-recommends\fP\&. E\&.g\&. supplied to the mount command using augeas above, comments will automatically transformed to metadata to avoid cluttering of the real configuration\&.
.PP
.SS "Library Split"
.PP
Up to now, Elektra consisted only of a single shared library, \fClibelektra\&.so\fP\&. Not all symbols in it were relevant to end users, for example, some were only needed by plugins\&. Others were only proposed and not yet part of the stable API\&. And finally, other symbols were not needed in some situations, e\&.g\&. the plugins do not need the \fCkdb\fP interface\&.
.PP
Thus, we split \fClibelektra\&.so\fP, so that only coherent parts are in the same library:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fClibelektra-core\&.so\fP only contains the \fCKeySet\fP data structure and module loading\&. Every binary using Elektra should link against it\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fClibelektra-kdb\&.so\fP contains the missing \fCKDB\fP symbols\&. Together with the \fCcore\fP they contain everything declared in \fCkdb\&.h\fP\&. Michael Zehender plans to have multiple variants of \fClibelektra-kdb\&.so\fP that use different kinds of concurrency\&. Headerfile: \fC<kdb\&.h>\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fClibelektra-ease\&.so\fP adds functionality missing in \fCcore\fP to make the life for C programmers easier\&. New headerfile: \fCkdbease\&.h\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fClibelektra-proposal\&.so\fP adds functionality proposed for \fCcore\fP\&. It directly uses internal structures of \fCcore\fP, thus they always need to have exactly the same version\&. Headerfile: \fC\fBkdbproposal\&.h\fP\fP
.PP
.PP
The source code is now better organized by the introduction of a \fClibs\fP folder\&. The explanation of every library can be found in \fC/src/libs/\fP\&.
.PP
The rationale of the library split is documented \fBhttps:\fP//github\&.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/doc/decisions/library_split\&.md 'here'\&. Shortly put, it was needed for further evolution and allowing us to grow and enhance without getting a fat core\&.
.PP
Thanks to Manuel Mausz for fixing many bugs related to the library split and also adapting all the bindings for it\&.
.PP
.SS "Benchmark"
.PP
To show that the split does not make Elektra slower, Mihael PranjiÄ made a small benchmark\&. The real time of \fCbenchmarks/large\fP and revision 634ad924109d3cf5d9f83c33aacfdd341b8de17a
.PP
.IP "1." 4
kdb-static: Median :0\&.8800
.IP "2." 4
kdb-full: Median :0\&.8700
.IP "3." 4
kdb: Median :0\&.8700
.PP
.PP
So it seems that the split does not influence the time of running elektrified processes\&.
.PP
\fITimes were measured with time(1) and the median is calculated for 21 runs of benchmarks/large\&. This was done using \fCscripts/benchmark_libsplit\&.sh\fP\fP
.PP
.SS "Compatibility"
.PP
As always, the ABI and API is fully forward-compatible, i\&.e\&. programs compiled against an older 0\&.8 version of Elektra will continue to work (ABI) and you will be able to recompile every program without errors (API)\&.
.PP
We added \fCkeyGetNamespace\fP which allows us to handle all namespaces in a switch and to iterate all namespaces\&. This is essential, when a new namespace is added, thus then the compiler can warn you about every part where the new namespace is not yet considered\&. We currently do not plan to add a new namespace, but better be safe than sorry\&.
.PP
The internal function \fCkeyCompare\fP now also detects any metadata change\&.
.PP
libtools was nearly rewritten\&. Even though it is mostly API compatible (you should not use the low-level \fCBackend\fP anymore but instead use the \fCBackendBuilder\fP), it is certainly not ABI compatible\&. If you have an undefined symbol: \fC_ZN3kdb5tools7Backend9addPluginESsNS_6KeySetE\fP you need to recompile your tool\&. Even the merging part has ABI incompatibility (different size of \fC_ZTVN3kdb5tools7merging14NewKeyStrategyE\fP)\&. Unfortunately, we still cannot guarantee compatibility in \fClibtools\fP, further changes are planned (e\&.g\&. implementing mounting of lazy plugins)\&.
.PP
The python(2) and lua interfaces changed, an additional argument (the plugin configuration) is passed to \fCopen\fP\&.
.PP
The INI plugin was rewritten, so many options changed in incompatible ways\&.
.PP
The default format plugin (e\&.g\&. for import/export) is no longer hard coded to be \fCdump\fP\&. Instead KDB_DEFAULT_STORAGE will be used\&. To get KDB_DEFAULT_STORAGE you can use the constants plugin: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb mount-info
    kdb get system/info/elektra/constants/cmake/KDB_DEFAULT_STORAGE

.fi
.PP
.PP
Thanks to Manuel Mausz plugins do no longer export any method other than \fCelektraPluginSymbol\fP\&. It now will fail if you directly linked against plugins and did not correctly use their public interface\&. Please use the module loading and access functions via the contract\&.
.PP
The CMake and Pkgconfig Files now only link against \fCelektra-core\fP and \fCelektra-kdb\fP\&. If you used some symbols not present in \fCkdb\&.h\fP, your application might not work anymore\&.
.PP
\fClibelektra\&.so\fP is still present for compatibility reasons\&. It should not be used for new applications\&. Some unimportant parts, however, moved to the 'sugar' libraries\&. E\&.g\&. the symbol \fCelektraKeyCutNamePart\fP is no longer part of \fClibelektra\&.so\fP\&.
.PP
.SS "Bootstrapping"
.PP
When you use \fCkdbOpen\fP in Elektra as first step it reads mountpoint configuration from \fC/elektra\fP\&. This step is the only hard coded one, and all other places of the KDB's tree can be customized as desired via mounting\&.
.PP
The bootstrapping now changed, so that \fC/elektra\fP is not part of the default configuration \fCdefault\&.ecf\fP (or as configured with \fCKDB_DB_FILE\fP), but instead we use \fCelektra\&.ecf\fP (or as configured with \fCKDB_DB_INIT\fP)\&. This behaviour solves the problem that \fCdefault\&.ecf\fP was read twice (and even differently, once for \fC/elektra\fP and once for \fC/\fP)\&.
.PP
To be fully compatible with previous mountpoints, Elektra will still read mountpoints from \fCdefault\&.ecf\fP as long as \fCelektra\&.ecf\fP is not present\&.
.PP
To migrate the mountpoints to the new method, simply use: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb upgrade-bootstrap

.fi
.PP
.PP
which basically exports \fCsystem/elektra/mountpoints\fP, then does \fCkdb rm -r system/elektra/mountpoints\fP so that \fCdefault\&.ecf\fP will be without an mountpoint and thus the compatibility mode does not apply anymore\&. As last step it will import again what it exported before\&.
.PP
\fBhttps:\fP//github\&.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/doc/decisions/bootstrap\&.md 'Details are here'
.PP
.SS "Plugins"
.PP
We already highlighted the new \fCspec\fP plugin, but also other plugins were improved at many places\&. Small other changes are:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Conditionals now also support \fCassign/condition\fP syntax, thanks to Thomas Waser
.IP "\(bu" 2
Lua and Python are not tagged experimental anymore\&. They now correctly add their configuration to the open-call\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The plugin \fCyajl\fP (the json parser and generator) now also accepts the type \fCstring\fP and yields better warnings on wrong types\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Improved error message in the \fCtype\fP plugin\&.
.PP
.PP
Larger changes were done in the following plugins:
.PP
.SS "INI"
.PP
The INI plugin was rewritten and a huge effort was taken so that it fully-roundtrips and additionally preserves all comments and ordering\&. Currently, it is brand new\&. It is planned that it will replace \fCdump\fP in the future\&.
.PP
Currently is has some minor problems when used as KDB_DEFAULT_STORAGE\&. You can avoid most problems by mounting a different file into root: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb mount root.ini /

.fi
.PP
.PP
Read \fChere about the details\fP\&.
.PP
A huge thanks to Thomas Waser\&.
.PP
.SS "Rename"
.PP
Thanks to Thomas Waser \fCrename\fP is now fixed for cascading keys\&. Additionally, it does not change the \fCsync\fP status of the keys so that notification plugins work properly afterwards\&.
.PP
.SS "Crypto"
.PP
The crypto plugin is a facility for securing sensitive Keys by symmetric encryption of the value\&. It acts as a filter plugin and it will only operate on Keys, which have the meta-key âcrypto/encryptâ set\&.
.PP
The key derivation is still work-in-progress, so the plugin does not work with kdb yet\&. A planned method for key derivation is to utilize the gpg-agent\&.
.PP
For now the plugin requires the following Keys within the plugin configuration in order to work properly:
.PP
.IP "1." 4
/crypto/key - the cryptographic key (binary 256 bit long)
.IP "2." 4
/crypto/iv - the initialization vector (binary 128 bit long)
.PP
.PP
Please note that this method of key input is for testing purposes only and should never be used in a productive environment!
.PP
Thanks to Peter Nirschl, especially the patience for also supporting different platforms where dependencies need to be handled differently\&.
.PP
.SS "KDB"
.PP
A technical preview of a new tool was added: \fCkdb editor\fP allows you to edit any part of Elektraâs configuration with any editor and any syntax\&. It uses 3-way merging and other stable technology, but it currently does not provides a way to abort editing\&. So you only should use it with care\&.
.PP
The tool \fCkdb list\fP now searches in the rpath for libraries and thus will also find plugins not present at compile time (using \fCglob\fP)\&. Additionally, it sorts the plugins by \fCinfos/status\fP score, which can also be printed with \fC-v\fP\&. The last plugins printed are the ones ranked highest\&.
.PP
When running as root, \fCkdb\fP will now use the \fCsystem\fP namespace when writing configuration to cascading key names\&.
.PP
Long paths are cumbersome to enter in the CLI\&. Thus one can define bookmarks now\&. Bookmarks are key names that start with \fC+\fP\&. They are only recognized by the \fCkdb\fP tool or tools that explicitly have support for it\&. Applications should not depend on the presence of a bookmark\&. For example, if you set the bookmark kdb: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb set user/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/bookmarks
    kdb set user/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/bookmarks/kdb user/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current

.fi
.PP
.PP
You are able to use: 
.PP
.nf
    kdb ls +kdb/bookmarks
    kdb set +kdb/format ini

.fi
.PP
.PP
The kdb tool got much more robust when the initial configuration is broken, no man page viewer is present or Elektra was installed wrongly\&.
.PP
The \fC--help\fP usage is unified and improved\&.
.PP
The new key naming conventions are now used for configuration of the \fCkdb\fP-tool itself: \fC/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/%/\fP and \fC/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/\fP are additionally read\&. The option \fC-p\fP/\fC--profile\fP is now supported for every command, it allows to fetch configuration from \fC/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/<profile>/\fP instead of \fCcurrent\fP\&. KDB is more robust when it cannot fetch its own configuration due to KDB errors\&.
.PP
.SS "Coding Guidelines"
.PP
Thanks to Kurt Micheli the code guidelines are \fBhttps:\fP//github\&.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/doc/CODING\&.md 'now properly documented'\&. Thanks to RenÃ© Schwaiger we also provide a style file for clang-format\&.
.PP
Furthermore we unified and fixed the source:
.IP "\(bu" 2
only use @ for doxygen commands
.IP "\(bu" 2
always use elektra* functions for allocation
.IP "\(bu" 2
added a file header for every file
.PP
.PP
.SS "C++11 migration"
.PP
Since we now only use C++11, we applied \fCclang-modernize\fP which simplified many loops and replaced many \fC0\fP to \fCnullptr\fP\&. Additionally, we added \fCoverride\fP and \fCdefault\fP at many places\&.
.PP
We removed all places where we had \fCifdefs\fP to use \fCauto_ptr\fP if no modern smart pointer is available\&.
.PP
Because of these changes there is no easy way to compile Elektra without C++11 support, except by avoiding the C++ parts all together\&.
.PP
The C++ \fCKeySet\fP now also supports a \fCget\fP to retrieve whole containers at once\&. By specializing \fCKeySetTypeWrapper\fP you can support your own containers\&. Currently only \fCmap<string, T>\fP is supported (T is any type supported by \fCKey::get\fP)\&.
.PP
If you haven't removed it from your flags already, there is no use anymore to set \fCENABLE_CXX11\fP\&.
.PP
.SS "Documentation"
.PP
The documentation was improved vastly\&. Most thanks to Kurt Micheli who did a lot of editing and fixed many places throughout the documentation Also thanks to Michael Zehender who added two paragraphs in the main README\&.md\&.
.PP
Key names of applications should be called \fC/sw/org/app/#0/current\fP, where \fCcurrent\fP is the default profile (non given)\&. \fCorg\fP and \fCapp\fP is supposed to not contain \fC/\fP and be completely lowercase\&. Key names are documented \fBhere\fP\&. \fBSee also here\fP\&. The main reason for long paths is the provided flexibility in the future (e\&.g\&. to use profiles and have a compatible path for new major versions of configuration)\&. By using bookmarks, users should not be confronted by it too often\&.

.PP
Thanks to \fCHarald Geyer\fP, Elektra is now packaged for OpenWRT\&. We fixed a number of cross-compilation issues and now officially support building against musl libc, with one minor limitation: RPATH works differently on musl so you need to install all plugins directly in /usr/lib/ or set LD_LIBRARY_PATH\&. Report any bugs in \fCHarald's OpenWRT packaging issue tracker\fP\&.
