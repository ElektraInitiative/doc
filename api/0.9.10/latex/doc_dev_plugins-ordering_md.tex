 You should first read elektra-\/plugins to get an idea about plugins.

This document describes how elektra-\/plugins are ordered with \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_help_elektra-backends_md}{elektra-\/backends(7)}}.

Multiple plugins open up many ways in which they can be arranged. A simple way is to have one array with pointers to plugins. To store a {\ttfamily Key\+Set}, the first plugin starts off with the {\ttfamily Key\+Set} passed to it. The resulting {\ttfamily Key\+Set} is given to the next plugin. This is repeated for every plugin in the array.

To obtain a {\ttfamily Key\+Set}, the array of plugins is processed the other way round. An empty {\ttfamily Key\+Set} is passed to the last plugin. The resulting {\ttfamily Key\+Set} is handed over to the previous one until the first plugin is executed.

This approach has shown not to be powerful enough to express all use cases by counter-\/evidence. Logging should take place after the storage plugin performs its actions in both directions. It is not possible to do this with a {\itshape single array} processed in a way as described above.\hypertarget{doc_dev_plugins-ordering_md_autotoc_md2320}{}\doxysection{Separated lists}\label{doc_dev_plugins-ordering_md_autotoc_md2320}
Two individual lists (get+set list) of plugins solve the described problem. Instead of bidirectional processing of a single list two separate arrays are used. It turns out that error scenarios also make this approach unsuccessful. When a plugin fails, no other plugin must be executed later on because it might depend on the previous plugin to work correctly. In {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga28e385fd9cb7ccfe0b2f1ed2f62453a1}{kdb\+Get()}}}, this works well -- the update process will be stopped. But during {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga11436b058408f83d303ca5e996832bcf}{kdb\+Set()}}}, changes to the file system must be reverted. Plugins can leave a lock, temporary file or journal. These resources need to be cleaned up properly.\hypertarget{doc_dev_plugins-ordering_md_autotoc_md2321}{}\doxysection{Error List}\label{doc_dev_plugins-ordering_md_autotoc_md2321}
So every backend additionally needs a third array that is executed in error scenarios during {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga11436b058408f83d303ca5e996832bcf}{kdb\+Set()}}}. Plugins responsible for the cleanup, rollback or error notification are inserted into it.

The resolver plugin requires this error list to do a proper rollback. Another use case is logging after a failure has happened.\hypertarget{doc_dev_plugins-ordering_md_autotoc_md2322}{}\doxysection{Placements}\label{doc_dev_plugins-ordering_md_autotoc_md2322}
The ordering of plugins inside these three arrays is controlled by \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_help_elektra-contracts_md}{elektra-\/contracts(7)}}. Each of the three arrays has ten slots. These slots have names to be referred to in the contract.
