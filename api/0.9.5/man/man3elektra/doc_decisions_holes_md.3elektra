doc_decisions_holes_mdHoles and Non-leaf values in KeySets 
 \- A hole is the absence of a key, which has keys below it, e\&.g\&. if \fCsome/key\fP is missing in a property file:
.PP
.PP
.nf
some = value
some/key/below = value
.fi
.PP
.PP
\fCsome\fP has a non-leaf value\&. Another example of a non-leaf value in XML (\fCabc\fP): \fC<abc>value<def>value2</def></abc>\fP interpreted by xerces plugin:
.PP
.PP
.nf
abc/def = value2
abc = value
.fi
.PP
.PP
Config files ideally do not copy any structure if they only want to set a single key\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
strongly hierarchically structured data must still be supported
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
data structure must always be complete
.IP "\(bu" 2
prohibit non-leaves values
.PP
.PP
Support holes and values for non-leaves in a KeySet if the underlying format allows it\&.
.PP
If the underlying format does not support it and there is also not an obvious way how to circumvent it -- e\&.g\&., JSON which does not have comments -- holes and values in non-leaves can be supported with key names starting with Â®elektra\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
It fits very good to the idea of key-value\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Some formats support it (e\&.g\&. XML supports non-leaves values; property-files support holes)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
It can be useful for migration purposes, e\&.g\&. there is \fC/some/key\fP, and later \fC/some/key/enable\fP gets added\&. Then it is beneficial if \fC/some/key\fP still can hold a value\&.
