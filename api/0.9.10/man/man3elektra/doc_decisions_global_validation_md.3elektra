.SH NAME
doc_decisions_global_validation_md \- Global Validation 
 
.SH "Problem"
.PP
Links and validation constraints might point to keys not loaded with the respective \fCkdbGet\fP\&.
.SH "Constraints"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
no workaround such as \fCkdb get -a\fP
.PP
.SH "Assumptions"
.PP
.SH "Considered Alternatives"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
global plugin can register additional backends to load
.IP "\(bu" 2
split \fCkdbGet\fP into multiple steps:
.IP "  1." 6
do \fCkdbGet\fP on \fCsystem:/elektra\fP to update mount points
.IP "  2." 6
first do \fCkdbGet\fP on the \fCspec:/\fP-namespace
.IP "  3." 6
then calculate which backends are needed
.IP "  4." 6
then fetch all backends as needed
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
split loops in \fCkdbGet\fP not only according placements but also according namespace (get spec first)
.PP
.SH "Decision"
.PP
Not supported, admins/maintainers need to stay with their spec within what applications request by \fCkdbGet\fP\&.
.SH "Rationale"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
it is too expensive to always load all keys (@mpranj: is this true?)
.IP "\(bu" 2
problems in implementing to always get everything
.IP "\(bu" 2
it makes the parameter to \fCkdbGet\fP basically useless
