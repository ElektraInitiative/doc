An empty Key\+Set is passed to \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga11436b058408f83d303ca5e996832bcf}{kdb\+Set()}}. What is the correct persistent representation?


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item User does not want empty files lying around everywhere.
\item User wants to come back to a clean situation using Elektra
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item no file, no empty directories
\item keep directories, remove configuration file
\item plugins write minimal, syntactical-\/valid configuration file
\item plugins do whatever they think is correct
\item remember initial situation at mounting time and restore it when empty key is passed (seems inefficient and complicated?)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Remove files on empty Key\+Set.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item allows user to undo what a previous \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga11436b058408f83d303ca5e996832bcf}{kdb\+Set()}} did
\item easy to understand semantics
\item makes storage plugins easier (do not need to remove files)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item less empty files are left
\item no invalid empty files (yajl bugs)
\end{DoxyItemize}
