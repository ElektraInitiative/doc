The Markdown link Converter, which filters markdown pages before the processing of doxygen, converts the links in markdown pages. It is set up as input filter in doxygen, if a markdown file is desired to be in the A\+P\+I documentation it only must have the extension {\ttfamily .md} and be in the {\ttfamily I\+N\+P\+U\+T} path.

The Markdown link Converter gives each markdown file a header {\ttfamily \{ \#header \}} which is attached to a title and converts the links to refer to this headers. This conversion happens in 2 passes, which is needed because there can be files with no title.

\subsection*{Usage for manual invocation}

\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries The $<$input-\/file$>$ parameter must be an absolute path!}
