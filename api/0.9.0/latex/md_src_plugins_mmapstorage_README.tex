This is a high performance storage plugin that supports full Elektra semantics.

\subsection*{Format}

The storage format uses Elektra\textquotesingle{}s in-\/memory data layout and employs the {\ttfamily mmap()} system call to read/write data. The format is not portable across different architectures/platforms. The format can be seen as a memory dump of a keyset. Therefore, the files must not be edited by hand. Files written by mmapstorage are not intended to be human-\/readable.

\subsection*{Usage}

Mount mmapstorage using {\ttfamily kdb mount}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo kdb mount config.mmap user/tests/mmapstorage mmapstorage
\end{DoxyCode}


Unmount mmapstorage using {\ttfamily kdb umount}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo kdb umount user/tests/mmapstorage
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Compiling}

The mmapstorage has two compilation variants\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item mmapstorage
\item mmapstorage\+\_\+crc
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The {\ttfamily mmapstorage} will always be compiled on a supported system (see \href{#dependencies}{\tt Dependencies}). When zlib is available, we will additionally compile the {\ttfamily mmapstorage\+\_\+crc} variant. The first variant does not do a C\+R\+C32 checksum of the critical data, while the second variant always checks the C\+R\+C32 checksum for additional security.

\subsection*{Dependencies}

P\+O\+S\+IX compliant system (including X\+SI extensions).

Additionally, zlib is needed for the {\ttfamily mmapstorage\+\_\+crc} compilation variant\+: {\ttfamily zlib1g-\/dev} or {\ttfamily zlib-\/devel}.

\subsection*{Examples}

``{\ttfamily  $<$h1$>$Mount mmapstorage to}user/tests/mmapstorage` sudo kdb mount config.\+mmap user/tests/mmapstorage mmapstorage

\section*{Add some values via {\ttfamily kdb set}}

kdb set user/tests/mmapstorage \textquotesingle{}Some root key\textquotesingle{} kdb set user/tests/mmapstorage/dir \textquotesingle{}Directory within the hierarchy.\textquotesingle{} kdb set user/tests/mmapstorage/dir/leaf \textquotesingle{}A leaf node holding some valuable data.\textquotesingle{} kdb setmeta user/tests/mmapstorage/dir/leaf super\+Meta\+Key \textquotesingle{}Metadata is supported too.\textquotesingle{}

\section*{List the configuration tree below {\ttfamily user/tests/mmapstorage}}

kdb ls user/tests/mmapstorage \#$>$ user/tests/mmapstorage \#$>$ user/tests/mmapstorage/dir \#$>$ user/tests/mmapstorage/dir/leaf

\section*{Retrieve the new values}

kdb get user/tests/mmapstorage \#$>$ Some root key kdb get user/tests/mmapstorage/dir \#$>$ Directory within the hierarchy. kdb get user/tests/mmapstorage/dir/leaf \#$>$ A leaf node holding some valuable data. kdb getmeta user/tests/mmapstorage/dir/leaf super\+Meta\+Key \#$>$ Metadata is supported too.

\section*{Undo modifications to the database}

kdb rm -\/r user/tests/mmapstorage

\section*{Unmount mmapstorage}

sudo kdb umount user/tests/mmapstorage ```

\subsection*{Limitations}

Mapped files shall not be altered, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The {\ttfamily mmap()} system call only supports regular files and so does the mmapstorage plugin with one notable exception\+: The plugin detects when it is called with the files {\ttfamily /dev/stdin} and {\ttfamily /dev/stdout} and makes an internal copy. This makes the plugin compatible with {\ttfamily kdb import} and {\ttfamily kdb export}.
