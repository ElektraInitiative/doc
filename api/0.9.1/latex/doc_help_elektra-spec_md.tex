spec is a special namespace that describes via metadata the semantics of individual keys.

Most importantly it\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item describes which keys are of interest to the application
\item describes the metadata to be copied to every key
\item describes how the cascading lookup works
\item describes the mount points including the plugins needed for them
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

It is, however, not limited to this but can express any other key database semantics (new plugins might be necessary, though).

The most simple use is to enlist all keys that will be used by an application and maybe give a description for them (we use ini syntax in this document)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[mykey]}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{[folder/anotherkey]}
\DoxyCodeLine{description = set this key if you want another behavior}
\end{DoxyCode}


So Keys in {\ttfamily spec} allow us to specify which keys are read by the application. The description key will be copied (referred to) to {\ttfamily folder/anotherkey} of any namespace, so that it can easily be accessed.

Other features are directly implemented in {\ttfamily ks\+Lookup}. When cascading keys (those starting with {\ttfamily /}) are used following features are now available (in the metadata of respective {\ttfamily spec}-\/keys)\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily override/\#}\+: use these keys {\itshape in favor} of the key itself (note that {\ttfamily \#} is the syntax for arrays, e.\+g. {\ttfamily \#0} for the first element, {\ttfamily \#\+\_\+10} for the 11th and so on)
\item {\ttfamily namespace/\#}\+: instead of using all namespaces in the predefined order, one can specify which namespaces should be searched in which order
\item {\ttfamily fallback/\#}\+: when no key was found in any of the (specified) namespaces the {\ttfamily fallback}-\/keys will be searched
\item {\ttfamily default}\+: this value will be used if nothing else was found
\end{DoxyItemize}

E.\+g.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[promise]}
\DoxyCodeLine{default=20}
\DoxyCodeLine{fallback/\#0=/somewhere/else}
\DoxyCodeLine{namespace/\#0=user}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item When this file is mounted to {\ttfamily spec/sw/app/\#0} we specify, that for the key {\ttfamily /sw/app/\#0/promise} only the namespace {\ttfamily user} should be used.
\item If this key was not found, but {\ttfamily /somewhere/else} is present, we will use this key instead. The {\ttfamily fallback} technique is very powerful\+: it allows us to have (recursive) links between applications. In the example above, the application is tricked in receiving e.\+g. the key {\ttfamily user/somewhere/else} when {\ttfamily promise} was not available.
\item The value {\ttfamily 20} will be used as default, even if no configuration file is found.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Note that the fallback, override and cascading works on {\itshape key level}, and not like most other systems have implemented, on configuration {\itshape file level}.

You can tag any key using the {\ttfamily check} metadata so that it will be validated.

For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[folder/anotherkey]}
\DoxyCodeLine{check/validation = abc.*}
\DoxyCodeLine{check/validation/message = def does not start with abc}
\end{DoxyCode}


In the spec namespace you can also specify mount points. First you need the metakey {\ttfamily mountpoint} and a configuration file name. Otherwise, it basically works in the same way as the contracts in plugins using {\ttfamily infos} and {\ttfamily config}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[]}
\DoxyCodeLine{mountpoint=file.abc}
\DoxyCodeLine{config/plugin/code/escape = 40}
\DoxyCodeLine{config/plugin/lua\#abc/script = abc\_storage.lua}
\DoxyCodeLine{infos/author = Markus Raab}
\DoxyCodeLine{infos/needs = resolver\_abc rename code lua\#abc}
\DoxyCodeLine{infos/recommends = hexcode}
\end{DoxyCode}
