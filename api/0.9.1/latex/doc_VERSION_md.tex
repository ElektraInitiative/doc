The version of Elektra is handled with the kdb.\+h macros {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+ON} which is a string and {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+M\+A\+J\+OR}, {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+M\+I\+N\+OR} and {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+M\+I\+C\+RO} which are numbers. They represent the public announced version information.

This is the A\+PI to programs using Elektra. Its interface is defined in src/include/kdb.h. Both applications and plugins use this A\+PI.

Additionally there is also a very small A\+PI to plugins. It consists of only 5 functions and is described in \href{/home/mpranj/workspace/libelektra/src/plugins/doc/doc.c}{\texttt{ src/plugins/doc/doc.\+c}}.

This section describes under which circumstances A\+PI and A\+BI incompatibilities may occur. As developer from Elektra your mission is to avoid that. The tool icheck against the interfaces mentioned above may help you too.

In {\ttfamily 0.\+8.$\ast$} the A\+PI and A\+BI must be always forward-\/compatible, but not backwards-\/compatible. That means that a program written and compiled against 0.\+8.\+0 compiles and links against 0.\+8.\+1. But because it is not necessarily backwards-\/compatible a program written for 0.\+8.\+1 may not link or compile against elektra 0.\+8.\+0 (but it may do when you use the compatible subset, maybe with \#ifdefs).

Following points are allowed\+: When you add a new function you break A\+BI and A\+PI backward-\/ compatibility, but not forward, so you are allowed to do so.

In the signature you are only allowed to add const to any parameter. You are {\itshape not} allowed to use subtypes to the objects, in C means you are not allowed to call any functions of an object which appear new. C does {\itshape not} type check that, it\textquotesingle{}s your responsibility.

What C also does not check are the pre and postconditions. That means you are not allowed to demand more client code (e.\+g. first accept a N\+U\+LL pointer and in the next version you crash on it) and you are not allowed to return values that the previous version did not return. It is a complex topic, so better don\textquotesingle{}t underestimate it, but generally said the methods should behave on the same data the same way.

This section describes how to increment the {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+ON}. It consists of a triplet integer {\ttfamily current\+:revision\+:age}.

{\ttfamily revision} is something which will always incremented when there is a new bug fix release.

{\ttfamily current} and {\ttfamily age} will be incremented by one when you release a compatible but changed A\+PI. The revision is set back to zero then.

Note\+: All 3 versioning infos are handled separately!
