It can get quite cumbersome to find out about key interrelations like arrays.

The alternative would be to have semantics in key names, with following advantages\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item maybe less metadata to save memory (only array?)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Do not encode any semantics into the key names. All semantic must be in metadata.

There are, however, rules and conventions which syntax to use for specific semantics. The {\ttfamily spec} plugin guards these rules.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{doc_decisions_array_md}{Arrays}
\end{DoxyItemize}
