This plugin is a check plugin which checks string values of Keys using regular expressions.

\subsection*{Usage}

The validation plugin looks for two metakeys. {\ttfamily check/validation} gives a regular expression to check against. If it is present, {\ttfamily check/validation/message} may contain an optional humanly readable message that will be passed with the error information.

Important\+: To validate against the whole string, you have to start the regular expression with {\ttfamily $^\wedge$} and end it with {\ttfamily \$}. Otherwise expressions that e.\+g. match the empty string, always return true. Alternatively, you can use {\ttfamily check/validation/match=L\+I\+N\+E}.

\subsection*{Configuration}

Metadata can be supplied to configure the validation\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily check/validation/match}\+: You can check against {\ttfamily L\+I\+N\+E}, {\ttfamily W\+O\+R\+D} or {\ttfamily A\+N\+Y}
\item {\ttfamily check/validation/ignorecase}\+: If you want to ignore case.
\item {\ttfamily check/validation/invert}\+: If you want to invert match.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Implementation}

The implementation consists of a loop checking for every key if it has the mentioned metakey. The check itself is done by the P\+O\+S\+I\+X regular expression library with the interface {\ttfamily regcomp}, {\ttfamily regexec}, {\ttfamily regerror} and {\ttfamily regfree}. The flag {\ttfamily R\+E\+G\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+E\+N\+D\+E\+D} is passed so that the regular expression will be compiled as an extended regular expression. {\ttfamily R\+E\+G\+\_\+\+N\+O\+S\+U\+B} gives a better performance and subexpressions cannot be used in this setup anyway.

\subsection*{Exported Methods}

The plugin also exports the function {\ttfamily ks\+Lookup\+R\+E()} that does a lookup in a Key\+Set using a regular expression. It starts from the current cursor of the Key\+Set and stops when the first value matches. Finally, this key is returned.
