In Elektra string-\/keys are preferred. Nevertheless, binary keys, i.\+e. strings with null-\/characters embedded are possible.

Sometimes a key does not exist at all. When using \hyperlink{group__keyset_gaa34fc43a081e6b01e4120daa6c112004}{ks\+Lookup()} you will get a null pointer. In the C++ Binding the null pointer is wrapped in a key. Thus this is also sometimes called {\bfseries N\+U\+L\+L K\+E\+Y\+S}.

Null values are binary values without content. They are the only keys that have the size 0.

Null values are always binary values.

\subsection*{E\+M\+P\+T\+Y V\+A\+L\+U\+E\+S}

Empty values point to a string that only contains a null byte.

Empty values are possible for both string and binary values.
