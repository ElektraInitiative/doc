Currently, a range of Elektra plugins are implementing some sort of change tracking for configuration data. This includes, but is not limited to, the \mbox{\hyperlink{md_src_plugins_internalnotification_README_src_plugins_internalnotification_README_md}{internalnotification}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{md_src_plugins_dbus_README_src_plugins_dbus_README_md}{dbus}} plugins. In the near future, Elektra shall also be extended with session recording.

KDB itself also has some rudimentary change tracking (via the {\ttfamily key\+Needs\+Sync} flag) to determine whether {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} needs to actually do something.

These competing change tracking implementations create multiple problems\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item pointless waste of resources, as data is duplicated in each plugin,
\item multiplication of code, generating a maintenance burden.
\item various subtle differences in change tracking behavior, e.\+g., {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} might write a config file but notification is not sent out
\item the current approach to change tracking in plugins is fragile, which is outlined in \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_decisions_0_drafts_operation_sequences_md}{a separate decision about valid kdb\+Get/kdb\+Set sequences}}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

For {\ttfamily Key\+Set} we need to track which of the keys\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item have been removed
\item have been added
\end{DoxyItemize}

For {\ttfamily Key} we need to track\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item original value of the key
\item size of the original value (for binary keys)
\item metadata, which is a combination of the tracking of keysets and keys
\item tracking should only be done on the following namespaces\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily system\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily user\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily dir\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily meta\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily spec\+:/}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2039}{}\doxysection{Constraints}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2039}
Change tracking must\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item be transparent for applications using the public Elektra API
\item be transparent to users changing configuration data
\item if overhead is not negligible\+: only do tracking as required, i.\+e., a plugin specifically requests it
\item have negligible overhead if disabled
\item not duplicate data for each plugin that wants change tracking
\item work with all allowed sequences of {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} and {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} as \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_decisions_0_drafts_operation_sequences_md}{per this decision}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

We only want to track changes that are done by the user, not changes that are done by plugins. I.\+e. the scope of change tracking is on what happens {\itshape outside} of {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} and {\ttfamily kdb\+Set}.

The library {\ttfamily libelektra-\/core} must be kept minimal.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2040}{}\doxysection{Assumptions}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2040}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is possible to do change tracking with reasonable memory and computation overhead
\item It is possible to design a single change tracking API that is useful for all existing and future plugins
\item False positives are okay
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item this may happen when some keys have been changed by the user, but have subsequentially been \char`\"{}unchanged\char`\"{} by a transformation plugin Scenario\+: plugin that converts {\ttfamily false}$<$-\/$>${\ttfamily 0} and {\ttfamily true}$<$-\/$>${\ttfamily 1}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily system\+:/background} is stored with value {\ttfamily false}
\item user gets key {\ttfamily system\+:/background} with value {\ttfamily 0} (after conversion by plugin)
\item user changes it to {\ttfamily false}
\item changetracking detects that value has been changed, because {\ttfamily false} != {\ttfamily 0}
\item plugin changes value from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily 0}
\item consumers of the changetracking API will now get a false positive if they query whether {\ttfamily system\+:/background} has been changed
\item We assume consumers of the changetracking API have access to both the previous and the new value of a changed key. Therefore, they could detect these false positive cases, if they need to.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item False negatives (missed changes) are not okay

We already store which keys have been returned by {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} for each backend within KDB. Currently, those are shallow copies. To be useful for changetracking, we need to perform deep copies instead. As keys and keysets are already utilizing copy-\/on-\/write, this would not add too much memory overhead.

A problem with this approach is that the internally stored keys are recreated as new instances every time {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} is called.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2043}{}\doxysubsection{Combine with internal cache}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2043}
We already decided that we want to have an internal deep-\/duped keyset of all the keys we returned. See \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_decisions_4_decided_internal_cache_md}{internal cache decision}}.

The difference to {\ttfamily backend\+Data-\/$>$keys} is that this cache is not recreated each time {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} is called.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2044}{}\doxysubsection{Have a seperate storage for changetracking}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2044}
Have a global keyset with deep-\/duped keys that is purely used for changetracking and nothing else.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2045}{}\doxysubsection{Store changes as meta keys}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2045}
When something changes for the first time, store the original value as a metakey to every key. Not yet clear how we handle changes to metadata then. Also not really possible for keysets.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2046}{}\doxysubsection{Implement changetracking as a mechanismn on the $<$tt$>$\+Key$<$/tt$>$ and $<$tt$>$\+Key\+Set$<$/tt$>$ datastructures}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2046}
The idea here is that we extend the {\ttfamily Key\+Set} and {\ttfamily Key} structs with additional fields.

The tracking itself would be done within the {\ttfamily ks$\ast$} and {\ttfamily key$\ast$} methods, after checking if it is enabled. It would also transparently work for metadata, as metadata itself is implemented as a keyset with keys.

Downsides of this approach\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It adds functionality to {\ttfamily libelektra-\/core} which may violate the constraint above. It may, however, be debatable whatever \textquotesingle{}minimal\textquotesingle{} means in this context.
\item Adding fields to the structs causes a slight memory overhead, even with tracking turned off. While negligible for {\ttfamily Key\+Set} due to the low amount of keysets in typical applications, it may be noticable for {\ttfamily Key}. On a 64-\/bit system we\textquotesingle{}d add 16 bytes to it. 8 bytes for the pointer to the original value, 8 bytes for the size of the original value. To put this in perspective, the current size of the {\ttfamily Key} struct is 64 bytes, so we\textquotesingle{}d add 25\% overhead to an empty key. However, this percentage will be much lower in a real-\/world application, as the usefulness of an empty key is very low.
\item Another downside here is that it is not so easy to determine what the \char`\"{}original\char`\"{} value is. Some part of {\ttfamily libelektra-\/kdb} would need to mark the keys as original (after transformations etc.)

Implement changetracking as a hooks plugin that will be called within {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} and {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} accordingly.

The following hooks will be needed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily tracking/get}\+: will be called at the end of {\ttfamily kdb\+Get}, directly before the result is returned.
\item {\ttfamily tracking/set}\+: will be called at the beginning of {\ttfamily kdb\+Set}.
\item {\ttfamily tracking/changeset}\+: compute the changeset for the requested parent key and return it.
\end{DoxyItemize}

As every hook plugin can define its own contract, in theory all storage forms mentioned in the previous chapter should be possible to implement. We could just point the plugin to {\ttfamily backends\+Data-\/$>$keys} or the internal cache if we go down that route.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2050}{}\doxysection{Solutions -\/ Query}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2050}
\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2051}{}\doxysubsection{Provide an API within $<$tt$>$libelektra-\/kdb$<$/tt$>$}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2051}
The API should be usable by plugins and by applications utilizing Elektra. It does not matter whether the changetracking is implemented as part of {\ttfamily libelektra-\/kdb} or as a separate plugin. The API may look something like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} elektraChangeTrackingIsEnabled (KDB * \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacekdb}{kdb}});}
\DoxyCodeLine{ChangeTrackingContext * elektraChangeTrackingGetContext (KDB * \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacekdb}{kdb}}, Key * parentKey);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{KeySet * elektraChangeTrackingGetAddedKeys (ChangeTrackingContext * context);}
\DoxyCodeLine{KeySet * elektraChangeTrackingGetRemovedKeys (ChangeTrackingContext * context);}
\DoxyCodeLine{KeySet * elektraChangeTrackingGetModifiedKeys (ChangeTrackingContext * context); \textcolor{comment}{// Returns old keys (pre-\/modification)}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} elektraChangeTrackingValueChanged (ChangeTrackingContext * context, Key * key);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} elektraChangeTrackingMetaChanged (ChangeTrackingContext * context, Key * key);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{KeySet * elektraChangeTrackingGetAddedMetaKeys (ChangeTrackingContext * context, Key * key);}
\DoxyCodeLine{KeySet * elektraChangeTrackingGetRemovedMetaKeys (ChangeTrackingContext * context, Key * key);}
\DoxyCodeLine{KeySet * elektraChangeTrackingGetModifiedMetaKeys (ChangeTrackingContext * context, Key * key); \textcolor{comment}{// Returns old meta keys (pre-\/modification)}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2052}{}\doxysubsection{Provide query methods as part of a separate plugin}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2052}
This solution only makes sense if changetrackig is implemented as part of a seperate plugin. It will be a bit challenging to use for applications, as it would require that applications have access to the plugin contracts.

The changetracking plugin needs to export at least functions for the following things in its contract\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Get added keys
\item Get removed keys
\item Get modified keys
\item Get added meta keys for a key
\item Get removed meta keys for a key
\item Get modified meta keys for a key

Plugin and application developers can declare that changetracking is required via a contract. Store deep-\/duped copy-\/on-\/write returned keys in a separate keyset, which we might also use as \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_decisions_4_decided_internal_cache_md}{internal cache}}. The whole changetracking logic lives within {\ttfamily libelektra-\/kdb}. We provide an API for developers with {\ttfamily libelektra-\/kdb}.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2054}{}\doxysection{Rationale}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2054}
This decision meets all the constraints.

We are not altering the behavior of already existing functions, so everything is transparent for applications using the public Elektra API. As changetracking is an opt-\/in feature, it will create zero runtime overhead and negligible memory overhead in usecases where it is not needed. There is only a single implementation and storage, so no duplication for each plugin that wants change tracking. As we are storing our own tracking data, all sequences of {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} and {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} should work.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2055}{}\doxysection{Implications}\label{doc_decisions_3_in_review_change_tracking_md_autotoc_md2055}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Documentation for changetracking APIs needs to be written
\item {\ttfamily struct \+\_\+\+KDB} needs to be extended to contain the keyset for changetracking
\item Replace all custom changetracking code within Elektra with this unified implementation. This should also include the {\ttfamily key\+Needs\+Sync} flag. It also includes switching all notification plugins to use the new API.
