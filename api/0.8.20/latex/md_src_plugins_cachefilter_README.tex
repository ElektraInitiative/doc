A global plugin that steps in during {\ttfamily \hyperlink{group__kdb_ga28e385fd9cb7ccfe0b2f1ed2f62453a1}{kdb\+Get()}} process to filter the results in a way, so that no other keys than the requested one or descendants of it are returned. During {\ttfamily \hyperlink{group__kdb_ga11436b058408f83d303ca5e996832bcf}{kdb\+Set()}} the filtered keys are added back to the output, so that they don\textquotesingle{}t get lost during the storage process. In other words, the plugin caches filtered keys to simplify the use of the A\+PI.
