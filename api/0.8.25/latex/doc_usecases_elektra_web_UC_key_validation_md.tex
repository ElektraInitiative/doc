\subsection*{Summary}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Title\+:} Key validation
\item {\bfseries Scope\+:} Configuration
\item {\bfseries Level\+:} User Goal
\item {\bfseries Actors\+:} User (usually a sysadmin)
\item {\bfseries Brief\+:} User gets feedback about a key\textquotesingle{}s contents.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Scenarios}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Extends\+:} Modifying keys, Adding keys, Drag \& Drop keys.
\item {\bfseries Main success scenario\+:} If the entered data passes the validation, it is sent to the backend and saved to the key database.
\item {\bfseries Alternative scenario\+:} User enters data that fails the field validation, the input field is marked as invalid (e.\+g. with a red color and some information text) and the data is N\+OT sent to the backend.
\item {\bfseries Alternative scenario\+:} User enters data that violates a validation rule, an error message is shown and the data is N\+OT saved to the key database.
\item {\bfseries Error scenario\+:} Technical problems while persisting to the key database. The user is informed about the problem.
\item {\bfseries Postcondition\+:} The updated key is persisted to the database.
\item {\bfseries Non-\/functional Constraints\+:} -\/
