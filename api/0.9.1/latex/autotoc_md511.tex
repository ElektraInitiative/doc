This plugin is a filter plugin which allows Elektra to better deal with null values and empty strings.

Elektra supports null values for binary keys. They differ from an empty string substantially in how they are handled. Some plugins that work on values are not aware of null values. They would crash when they try to access a value that is believed to be a string.

The plugin transcodes all null values to {\ttfamily @N\+U\+LL}, all empty strings to {\ttfamily @E\+M\+P\+TY}, and all strings starting with {\ttfamily @} to begin with {\ttfamily @@}.

In order to use the {\ttfamily null} plugin you must add {\ttfamily null} to {\ttfamily infos/needs} in the plugin you wish to use.

Once {\ttfamily null} is included in {\ttfamily infos/needs}, the null plugin will filter values for the storage plugin. As a result, the storage plugin will never come across a null value or an empty string, instead it will be get strings with {\ttfamily @N\+U\+LL} and {\ttfamily @E\+M\+P\+TY} respectively.
