\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily mountpoint} is where in the key database the new backend should be mounted to. It must be a cascading mount pount, i.\+e., {\ttfamily mountpoint} must start with {\ttfamily /}.
\item {\ttfamily plugin} are be extra Elektra plugins to be used (next to the one specified in {\ttfamily spec/}).
\item Plugins may be followed by a {\ttfamily ,} separated list of {\ttfamily keys=values} pairs which will be used as plugin configuration.

This command allows a user to mount a new {\itshape backend} described by an already mounted specification. To mount a specification file first use \hyperlink{md_doc_help_kdb-mount_doc_help_kdb-mount_md}{kdb-\/mount(7)}.

The idea of mounting is explained \hyperlink{md_doc_help_elektra-mounting_doc_help_elektra-mounting_md}{in elektra-\/mounting(7)} and.

The {\ttfamily spec} \hyperlink{md_doc_help_elektra-namespaces_doc_help_elektra-namespaces_md}{namespace} contains meta-\/configuration that describes the configuration in all other namespaces. The meta data used for the specification is described in \href{/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/doc/METADATA.ini}{\tt M\+E\+T\+A\+D\+A\+T\+A.\+ini}.

During {\ttfamily spec-\/mount} the {\ttfamily spec} keys are searched for relevant meta data\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For every meta data {\ttfamily mountpoint} an additional cascading mountpoint will be mounted.
\item The {\ttfamily infos/$\ast$} and {\ttfamily config/needs} from \href{/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/doc/CONTRACT.ini}{\tt C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+A\+C\+T.\+ini}, that are tagged by {\ttfamily usedby = spec}, will work as described there.
\item For other meta data suitable plugins are searched and mounted additionally.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+N\+T}

This command writes into the {\ttfamily /etc} directory and as such it requires root permissions. Use {\ttfamily kdb file system/elektra/mountpoints} to find out where exactly it will write to.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/\+H}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/help}\+: Show the man page.
\item {\ttfamily -\/\+V}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/version}\+: Print version info.
\item {\ttfamily -\/p}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/profile}=$<$profile$>$\+: Use a different kdb profile.
\item {\ttfamily -\/\+R}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/resolver}=$<$name$>$\+: Specify the resolver plugin to use if no resolver is given, the default resolver is used. See also \href{#KDB}{\tt below in K\+D\+B}. Note that the resolver will only added as dependency, but not directly added.
\item {\ttfamily -\/c}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/plugins-\/config}=$<$config$>$\+: Add a plugin configuration for all plugins.
\item {\ttfamily -\/\+W}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/with-\/recommends}\+: Also add recommended plugins and warn if they are not available.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/current/resolver}\+: The resolver that will be added automatically, if {\ttfamily -\/\+R} is not given.
\item {\ttfamily /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/current/plugins}\+: It contains a space-\/separated list of plugins and their configs which are added automatically (by default sync). The plugin-\/configuration syntax is as described above in the \href{#SYNOPSIS}{\tt synopsis}.

\subsection*{E\+X\+A\+M\+P\+L\+E\+S}

To mount /example as described in {\ttfamily spec/example}\+: {\ttfamily kdb spec-\/mount /example}

Additionally, add {\ttfamily ini} plugin (instead of some default resolver) with {\ttfamily some} as config\+: {\ttfamily kdb spec-\/mount /example ini some=value}
