Elektra keeps track of changes the user makes on data structures. Because the {\ttfamily Key\+Set} can be composed in the way the user wants it, the {\ttfamily Key\+Set} does not give enough information if changes occurred within. Instead, changes will be marked in individual {\ttfamily Key} objects. On modifying functions, the so-\/called {\bfseries sync flag} will be set.
