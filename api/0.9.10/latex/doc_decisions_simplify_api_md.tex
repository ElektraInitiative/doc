According to src/libs/elektra/symbols.\+map the public core API has 124 symbols¹, which is arguable too much for a key-\/value API which has as highest goal simplicity.

In particular following areas have many functions and are not simple\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item binary keys
\item memory functions
\item comparison functions
\item error/warnings
\end{DoxyItemize}

The urgency of this decision is that API can be easily introduced later but we cannot get rid of it after 1.\+0.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_simplify_api_md_autotoc_md2128}{}\doxysection{Constraints}\label{doc_decisions_simplify_api_md_autotoc_md2128}

Binary data is not a core feature, if needed the plugin system can also work without (properly tagged) binary data in key sets.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_simplify_api_md_autotoc_md2130}{}\doxysection{Considered Alternatives}\label{doc_decisions_simplify_api_md_autotoc_md2130}

The exact API changes are not listed here, because it would just a long list that could just as easily be found in the git history.

However, the API changes follow these rules\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Remove} all functions related to key metadata, except those listed below
\item {\itshape Remove} all functions related to keyset cursors, as well as {\ttfamily ks\+Head} and {\ttfamily ks\+Tail}
\item {\itshape Remove}/\+\_\+\+Change\+\_\+ all functions related to (binary) key values as described in (\mbox{\hyperlink{doc_decisions_binary_md}{Binary}})
\item {\itshape Remove} all functions that use a user-\/provided buffer to return keyname/value/etc.
\item {\itshape Change}/\+\_\+\+Add\+\_\+ {\ttfamily key\+Meta}/{\ttfamily key\+Set\+Meta} to directly read/write the metadata Key\+Set of a Key
\item {\itshape Rename} {\ttfamily key\+Get$\ast$\+Size} to {\ttfamily key$\ast$\+Size}
\item {\itshape Add} {\ttfamily ks\+Remove} function to remove a Key at a specific index
\item {\itshape Remove from public API} all the helper functions that use {\ttfamily elektra\+Malloc} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily elektra\+Format}), as well as all the helper functions that only enhance standard APIs with additional error checks (e.\+g. {\ttfamily elektra\+Str\+Cmp})
\item {\itshape Remove from public API} {\ttfamily ks\+Cut}, {\ttfamily ks\+Deep\+Dup}, {\ttfamily ks\+Copy\+Internal} and other functions that should never have been public
\item {\itshape Remove} all functions that can be replaced by others (e.\+g. {\ttfamily ks\+Pop})
\item {\itshape Rename} all functions to start with {\ttfamily elektra} as described in \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_decisions_elektra_prefix_md}{Elektra Prefix}}, and use {\ttfamily Key\+Set} instead of {\ttfamily ks} (also applies to names above)

¹ the 124 symbols are (as found by @kodebach)\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 6 for the KDB stuff
\item 6 for the plugin system
\item 48 for Key
\item 31 for Key\+Set
\item 15 other helper functions
\item The other 18 symbols are the public constants for the error API.
