.PP
This global semlock plugin introduces a read lock while \fCGET\fP and a read/write lock while \fCSET\fP\&.
.PP
A semaphore is used for the synchronisation and the implemented algorithm favors the writer, because updates should be propagated soon as possible\&.
.PP
The algorithm is described \fChere\fP\&.
.PP
The usage of this plugin could lead to deadlocks, due to an ongoing discussion (-10000) (\fCLink\fP)\&.
.PP
.SS "/dev/shm"
.PP
Is the location where the semaphores will be saved\&. \fC/dev/shm\fP should be mounted as tempfs, otherwise the semaphores can not be created (this issue only appears on older systems)\&. More information \fChere\fP\&.
