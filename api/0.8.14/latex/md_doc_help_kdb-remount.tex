{\ttfamily kdb remount $<$new path$>$ $<$new mountpoint$>$ $<$existing mountpoint$>$}

Where {\ttfamily new path} is the path to the file the user wants to mount, (Absolute for system files, relative for user files) {\ttfamily new mountpoint} is where in the key database the new configuration file should be mounted at, (For a cascading mount pount, {\ttfamily mountpoint} should start with {\ttfamily /}) and {\ttfamily existing mountpoint} is the mountpoint where the existing backend is mounted.
