\subsection*{What is Elektra?}

Elektra solves a non-\/trivial issue\+: how to abstract configuration in a way that software can be integrated and reconfiguration can be automated. Elektra solves this problem in a holistic way. Read https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/doc/\+W\+HY.md \char`\"{}why Elektra\char`\"{} for an explanation of why such a solution is necessary. It can be seen as a https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/doc/\+B\+I\+G\+P\+I\+C\+T\+U\+RE.md \char`\"{}virtual file system\char`\"{} for configuration files.

\subsection*{Highlights}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item more tutorials and getting started guides
\item new Ruby bindings
\item cleanup of core (only 124K for main library on Debian/amd64)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{More Tutorials}

Elektra already has an open and welcoming environment, with many interesting discussions. It is our interest that we keep it that way. To make this a bit more formal we added a https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/doc/code\+\_\+of\+\_\+conduct.md \char`\"{}code of
conduct\char`\"{}.

But without good introductions, it is easy to get lost in such a large initiative like Elektra. Thus we focused on writing great tutorials for this release!


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We wrote an https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/doc/tutorials/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}overview readme\char`\"{}
\item We wrote new tutorials about https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/doc/tutorials/mount.md \char`\"{}mounting\char`\"{} and https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/doc/tutorials/validation.md \char`\"{}validation\char`\"{} (thanks to Christoph Weber)
\item We wrote a readme to shell recorder transpiler which allows us to execute tutorials and verify that the examples in them work. (thanks to Thomas Waser)
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/lua}{\tt Lua} and \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/python}{\tt Python} plugins got tutorials and better explanations! (Thanks to Marvin Mall)
\item The \href{https://doc.libelektra.org/api/0.8.19/html/}{\tt doxygen} docu now also uses links to directories, thanks to Kurt Micheli!
\end{DoxyItemize}

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger for pointing to areas of improvement. A big thanks to Marvin Mall, Kurt Micheli, Christoph Weber and Thomas Waser!

If you like the tutorials, we would love to read from you. Please feel free to \href{https://git.libelektra.org/issues/new}{\tt start a discussion or ask a question}. We also added a https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/doc/help/elektra-\/faq.md \char`\"{}\+F\+A\+Q\char`\"{} and updated https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/.github/\+C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+I\+B\+U\+T\+I\+N\+G.\+md \char`\"{}\+C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+I\+B\+U\+T\+I\+N\+G\char`\"{}

\subsubsection*{Ruby Bindings}

We now provide Ruby bindings for Elektra. The bindings are based on the C++ bindings and are generated by S\+W\+IG. A strong focus was put on a good integration with standard Ruby features and conventions, such as naming conventions, predicates, key and meta data iteration...

A https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/src/bindings/swig/ruby/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}short introduction\char`\"{} shows some basic usage scenarios. More detailed examples can be found in the \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/bindings/swig/ruby/examples}{\tt examples directory}.

A big thanks to Bernhard Denner!

\subsubsection*{Cleanup of Core}

Following methods were hidden ({\ttfamily static}) or removed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily mount$\ast$} methods
\item {\ttfamily trie$\ast$} methods
\item {\ttfamily backend$\ast$}
\item {\ttfamily split$\ast$}
\item {\ttfamily key\+Get\+Parent\+Name\+Size}
\item {\ttfamily key\+Get\+Parent\+Name}
\end{DoxyItemize}

These are dozens of methods and it was required to adapt the unit tests to work with the hidden methods.

A big thanks to Kurt Micheli!

\subsection*{Usability}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved many error messages
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item spelling
\item be more friendly to the user
\item capitalization
\item mention {\ttfamily sudo !!}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily kdb set}\+: do not print what was not done
\item {\ttfamily kdb editor} handles non-\/modified files (will not do anything)
\item Be more chatty about what {\ttfamily kdb} does, can be disabled with {\ttfamily -\/q} or {\ttfamily /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/current/quiet}.
\item Furthermore, {\ttfamily -\/v} now tells even more details (e.\+g. {\ttfamily kdb-\/import} outputs the key about to import)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Plugins}

\subsubsection*{New}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/c}{\tt c plugin} generates C code that represents configuration. This is useful for unit tests or if you need to have hard-\/coded fallback configuration in your C application.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/base64}{\tt base64 plugin} allows you to encode binary data. This is especially handy in combination with the \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/crypto}{\tt crypto plugin} to avoid problems with non-\/printable characters in configuration files. (Thanks to Peter Nirschl)
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/fcrypt}{\tt fcrypt plugin} allows you to fully encrypt configuration files. They are only decrypted when applications access them. (Thanks to Peter Nirschl)
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/required}{\tt required plugin} rejects every key that is not required by an application.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/simplespeclang}{\tt simple spec lang} allows you to define metadata for \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/enum}{\tt enum} and required in a more compact way.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Major Enhancements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/simpleini}{\tt simpleini} got a configurable format in which it will read and write configuration files. For example, one can use {\ttfamily format=\% -\/$>$ \%} to have {\ttfamily key -\/$>$ value}.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/enum}{\tt enum} got support for multi-\/enums, i.\+e., multiple separated values within one value. The error reporting was improved, too. (Thanks to Thomas Waser)
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/glob}{\tt glob} accepts a list of named flags instead of an integer value and aborts matching after first hit. (Thanks to Felix Berlakovich)
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/hosts}{\tt hosts} now only accepts {\ttfamily ipv4} and {\ttfamily ipv6} keys. (Thanks to Felix Berlakovich)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Development}

In the perpetual effort to improve software quality, we made several improvements\+: (This information is mainly intended for Elektra’s developers.)


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A new logger encourages developers to write more comments ({\ttfamily E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+L\+OG})
\item {\ttfamily E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+A\+S\+S\+E\+RT} prints better messages on failure and does not need {\ttfamily \&\&} trick.
\item get rid of previous {\ttfamily V\+E\+R\+B\+O\+SE} macro at many places.
\item Many assertions were added in the low-\/level helpers (memory management)
\item Using the assertions we fixed some undefined behavior. (Thanks to Thomas Waser)
\item added new {\ttfamily configure-\/debian-\/debug} and {\ttfamily configure-\/debian-\/log} helper scripts
\item The build server now checks if builds with active logger and debugging work correctly.
\item Improved Coding Style in crypto\+\_\+botan (thanks to Peter Nirschl)
\item add {\ttfamily external-\/links.\+txt} to {\ttfamily outputs} (The file is generated in the build directory and contains all external-\/links. To validate them, use {\ttfamily ./scripts/link-\/checker}) (Thanks to Kurt Micheli)
\item {\ttfamily markdownlinkconverter} handles directories correctly (using {\ttfamily stat}). (Thanks to Kurt Micheli)
\item Fixed compiler warning caused by libxml2 (different behavior since 2.\+9.\+4), thanks to René Schwaiger
\item added often used links in https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}main R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E\char`\"{}
\item Improve documentation about failing test cases and what to do about it.
\item added \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/decisions/}{\tt decisions} about {\ttfamily plugin\+\_\+variants} and {\ttfamily array}. (Thanks to Marvin Mall)
\item Rename to metadata, metakey, mountpoint (Thanks to Peter Nirschl)
\item std\+::ios\+\_\+base\+::showbase can be used to output metadata when streaming keys (C++)
\item New {\ttfamily infos/status}\+: {\ttfamily readonly}, {\ttfamily writeonly}, {\ttfamily limited} (Thanks to Marvin Mall)
\item The tool {\ttfamily update-\/infos-\/status} orders {\ttfamily infos/status} and allows devs to easily add/rem entries. (Thanks to Kurt Micheli)
\item Automatic setting of {\ttfamily infos/status}\+: {\ttfamily nodoc}, {\ttfamily nodep}, {\ttfamily unittest}, {\ttfamily memleak}, {\ttfamily configurable} (Thanks to Kurt Micheli)
\item Improve {\ttfamily create\+\_\+lib\+\_\+symlink}, add {\ttfamily P\+L\+U\+G\+IN} argument and make it useful also for other library symlinks.
\item New markdown style applied to most markdown files. (Thanks to Marvin Mall)
\item Tracer is now disabled, even for {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG}. (Thanks to Marvin Mall)
\item Updated https\+://master.libelektra.\+org/doc/\+S\+E\+C\+U\+R\+I\+TY.md \char`\"{}\+S\+E\+C\+U\+R\+I\+T\+Y document\char`\"{}
\item Macro naming convention {\ttfamily E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+}, added {\ttfamily \hyperlink{kdbmacros_8h}{kdbmacros.\+h}}
\item {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} also works with {\ttfamily clang} and {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+A\+S\+AN} now allows devs to additionally enable sanitizers. Thanks to Gabriel Rauter.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Compatibility}

As always, the A\+BI and A\+PI of kdb.\+h is fully compatible, i.\+e. programs compiled against an older 0.\+8 version of Elektra will continue to work (A\+BI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (A\+PI).

It is now possible to enquiry which plugins provide a specific format. This needed changes in libtools, which got a new major revision. Changes in the plugin\textquotesingle{}s contract are fully compatible\+: You can now use {\ttfamily storage/ini} instead of {\ttfamily storage ini} in {\ttfamily infos/provides} which gives you the information that {\ttfamily ini} is a storage format (and not anything else the plugin might provide). For compatibility reasons, the build system still adds {\ttfamily storage ini} even if only {\ttfamily storage/ini} is specified.

That means that {\ttfamily kdb mount file.\+json /examples/json json} still will find {\ttfamily json} plugins even if they are not called {\ttfamily json} but \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/yajl}{\tt yajl}.

Another breaking change in {\ttfamily libtools} is that {\ttfamily append\+Namespace} was renamed to {\ttfamily prepend\+Namespace}.

Error messages changed a bit, so if you tried to parse them, make sure to make the {\ttfamily e} of error case-\/insensitive ({\ttfamily \mbox{[}eE\mbox{]}}).

In the C++ binding, {\ttfamily rewind\+Meta} is now {\ttfamily const} and some methods to check if a key is in a namespace were added.

The intercept libraries were moved to a \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/bindings/intercept}{\tt common folder}. They can now be included or excluded like other {\ttfamily B\+I\+N\+D\+I\+N\+GS}. For consistency reasons the libraries were also renamed ({\ttfamily libelektraintercept-\/fs.\+so} and {\ttfamily libelektraintercept-\/env.\+so.\+0}), but symlinks allow you to link against their old names ({\ttfamily lib/libelektraintercept.\+so} and {\ttfamily lib/libelektragetenv.\+so.\+0}).

\subsection*{Package Maintainers}

This information is intended for package maintainers.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item GI Bindings were removed from {\ttfamily B\+I\+N\+D\+I\+N\+GS=A\+LL}. It is recommended to use {\ttfamily S\+W\+IG} bindings instead, which will be added with {\ttfamily A\+LL}.
\item Intercept libraries are part of {\ttfamily B\+I\+N\+D\+I\+N\+GS}. They will be added on glibc systems where {\ttfamily B\+I\+N\+D\+I\+N\+GS=A\+LL} is used.
\item Documentation in textfiles is now installed, {\ttfamily T\+A\+R\+G\+E\+T\+\_\+\+D\+O\+C\+U\+M\+E\+N\+T\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+T\+E\+X\+T\+\_\+\+F\+O\+L\+D\+ER} was added for that purpose. The files are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Other new files are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Plugins\+: {\ttfamily libelektra-\/base64.\+so}, {\ttfamily libelektra-\/c.\+so}, {\ttfamily libelektra-\/fcrypt.\+so} {\ttfamily libelektra-\/required.\+so}, {\ttfamily libelektra-\/simplespeclang.\+so} (only in {\ttfamily E\+X\+P\+E\+R\+I\+M\+E\+N\+T\+AL}, not added by default, but with {\ttfamily A\+LL})
\item {\ttfamily site\+\_\+ruby/\+\_\+kdb.\+so} (ruby binding, only in {\ttfamily A\+LL})
\item {\ttfamily testcpp\+\_\+keyio}, {\ttfamily testkdb\+\_\+error}, {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+base64}, {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+fcrypt} (test binaries in {\ttfamily T\+A\+R\+G\+E\+T\+\_\+\+T\+O\+O\+L\+\_\+\+E\+X\+E\+C\+\_\+\+F\+O\+L\+D\+ER})
\end{DoxyItemize}

Changed files are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily libelektraintercept-\/env.\+so} (renamed from {\ttfamily libelektragetenv.\+so.}, but still available as symlink)
\item {\ttfamily libelektraintercept-\/fs.\+so} (renamed from {\ttfamily libelektraintercept.\+so}, but still available as symlink)
\item version upgrade\+: {\ttfamily libelektratools.\+so.\+2}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Portability}

Elektra should work on every system that has {\ttfamily cmake} and a {\ttfamily C/\+C++} compiler.

For this release we increased portability to better work with mac\+OS, Cent\+OS 7, and Open\+Suse 42.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item mac\+OS\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Travis build server now also build qt-\/gui
\item Support for xcode8 added (xcode6 still supported)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item fix lua != 5.\+2 issues (wrong output), update docu
\item remove hard dependency to {\ttfamily pkg-\/config}
\item remove hard dependency to version 3 of {\ttfamily cmake} (most parts still work with version 2)
\item make search for swig 2 visible
\item fix plugin names and mounting on Open\+Suse 42.\+1
\end{DoxyItemize}

A big thanks to Kai-\/\+Uwe Behrmann, Mihael Pranjić and Sebastian Bachmann.
