Suppose you have a plugin bar that exports the function {\ttfamily foo(\+Key $\ast$k)}. Then you can mount\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}kdb mount file.dump /example/iterate dump iterate when=bar foo Key
\end{DoxyVerb}


Which will execute {\ttfamily foo(k)} for every key that has the metadata {\ttfamily when}.
