shortDesc: adds python2 bindings, 3-way merge & improvements
.PP
.PP
Again, we managed to have a great feature release with dozens of corrections!
.PP
.SS "New Features"
.PP
Thanks to Manuel Mausz for further improving lua, python3 bindings and the new python2 bindings\&.
.PP
The GSoC efforts have their first large contribution to Elektra, the 3 way merge finally arrives with this release\&. It is still a long way to go, however, because augeas plugins can only be mounted with a workaround and the package integration of the 3-way merge is still in its infancy\&. More information about GSoC and its progress can be found \fChere\fP\&.
.PP
A special thanks to Felix Berlakovich for his contributions to the 3-way merge, including meta merging, conflict resolving strategies and extensive testing\&.
.PP
Additionally, he added the plugins keytometa, ini and greatly improved the glob plugin\&. These plugins are technical previews and will receive some improvements in the next release, too\&.
.PP
Now a script for tab completion is available \fBhere\fP, again thanks to Felix Berlakovich\&.
.PP
The contextual values now got a \fCtutorial\fP and small fixes\&.
.PP
.SS "Corrections"
.PP
Thanks to Pino Toscano for fixing a lot of spelling errors, simplify RPATH setting, respect $HOME and $TMPDIR, improvements of test cases, and his debian-packaging efforts\&.
.PP
In the kdb tool not allowed subfolders are now checked properly and the output of warnings comes before output of the error\&. This fixes the problem that in the case of a longer list of warnings one did not see the error anymore\&.
.PP
Fix compilation warnings on clang and gcc 4\&.9\&. Also improve test coverage on kdb tool and some plugins\&.
.PP
Fix kdb import/export for some plugins (Should now work with any storage plugin again)\&.
.PP
kdb run_all should run flawlessly with this release\&. Remaining problems with not installed test data were fixed\&. kdb run_all also checks if the test cases do not modify any existing key and keeps a backup if this happened\&.
.PP
Some remaining mem leaks in rare circumstances were fixed\&. Valgrind should now never report any leaks, if it does, please report the issue\&.
.PP
.SS "API Changes"
.PP
Added delMeta() for C++, because setMeta() with NULL will set the number 0 and not remove the meta\&.
.PP
Arguments of isBelow, isDirectBelow, isBelowOrSame are swapped for better readability\&. k\&.isBelow(root) now means the obvious thing\&. The change only effects the C++ binding, keyIsBelow is unaffected by the change\&.
.PP
.SS "Documentation"
.PP
\fCSpecification of metadata\fP and \fCcontracts\fP written/greatly improved\&.
.PP
\fBDecisions\fP are introduced again\&.
.PP
Most often the KeySet is ideal, e\&.g\&. when doing full iteration or when performing set operations\&. In some cases, however, a hierarchical data structure fits better\&. This is especially true for GUIs\&. Luckily, Keys can be in multiple data structures because of their reference counting\&.
.PP
.SS "Other Stuff"
.PP
We now fully embrace github:
.IP "\(bu" 2
We use its issue tracker (all issues from local text files were moved there)
.IP "\(bu" 2
We have rewritten many READMEs to use githubs markdown
.IP "\(bu" 2
On pull requests the build server checks if the merge would break the build\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
All previous gitorious users are now at github\&. (Most had an account anyway)
.PP
.PP
Raffael Pancheri also made progress with its qt-gui\&. It now features a model that implements great parts of Elektraâ€™s features\&. Unfortunately the model cannot be serialised and thus changes cannot made persistent\&. Also undo and other important use-cases are still not there\&. The GUI looks very clean and was evaluated in a SUS study on 23\&.07\&.2014\&. The current implementation can be found \fChere\fP\&.
.PP
Many distributions already have Elektra packages
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCFedora\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCGentoo\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCArch Linux\fP
.PP
.PP
In some distributions Elektra packages are available, but are not up-to-date\&. Pino Toscano is working on get them (actually Debian, but others are derived from it) up-to-date\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCUbuntu\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCDebian\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCLinux Mint\fP
.PP
.PP
A special thanks to Kai-Uwe Behrmann for providing packages for \fCCentOS, Fedora, OpenSUSE, RHEL and SLE\fP\&.
.PP
.SS "Get It!"
