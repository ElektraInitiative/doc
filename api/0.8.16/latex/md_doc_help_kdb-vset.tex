{\ttfamily kdb vset $<$path$>$ $<$value$>$ $<$regex$>$ \mbox{[}$<$message$>$\mbox{]}}

Where {\ttfamily path} is the path to the key the user wishes to set, {\ttfamily value} is the value the user wishes to set, and {\ttfamily regex} is the regular expression that should be used for validation. The optional parameter {\ttfamily message} is a user-\/defined message that will be displayed when a user tries to set the key to a value that doesn't match the regular expression. The expression will be matched against the whole value ({\ttfamily check/validation/match=L\+I\+N\+E}).

\subsection*{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N}

This command allows the user to set the value of a key and create a validation regular expression which future sets are checked against. This command supports regular expressions as defined in extended regular expressions. If a user tries to set a value that does not match the regular expression, a user-\/defined message is returned.

Note\+: In order for this command to work, the {\ttfamily validation} plugin must be mounted where the key resides.

To mount the necessary validation plugin use\+: {\ttfamily kdb mount validation.\+ini /validation ini validation}

To set the {\ttfamily user/validation/key} key to the value {\ttfamily a} and validate that any future sets must match the regular expression {\ttfamily a+}\+: {\ttfamily kdb vset user/validation/key a a+ \char`\"{}\+The value of this key must only consist of one more of the letter a\char`\"{}}
