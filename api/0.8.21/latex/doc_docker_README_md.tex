This Dockerfile builds a dockerimage based on ubuntu\+:artful including all requirements to build Elektra.

If \href{https://www.docker.com/}{\tt Docker} is available on your machine change to the directory containing the file you are currently reading and build the image with 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ docker build -t buildelektra .
\end{DoxyCode}


After the build process has completed you can create and run a Docker container that uses the image we just created. This runs bash in a container based on the buildelektra image and mounts the {\ttfamily ./data} folder into the container. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ mkdir data
$ docker run --rm -v $\{PWD\}/data:/mnt/share -it buildelektra bash
\end{DoxyCode}


The container contains a script that pulls a specified snapshot of Elektra from Github and either installs it in the container or builds a .deb package from it.

Try it out from within the container with 
\begin{DoxyCode}
# change into the mounted folder
$ cd /mnt/share
# this builds the commit with the tag "0.8.19"
$ buildelektra "0.8.19"
\end{DoxyCode}


After this command has finished you can safely test your specified Elektrasnapshot in the container.

If you would like to build a .deb package run buildelektra like with the {\ttfamily -\/b} flag\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ buildelektra -b elektra master
\end{DoxyCode}


When you exit the container you will find the created .deb package and the downloaded snapshots of Elektra in the data directory.
