This plugin checks whether the value of a key is a valid file system path\&.
.PP
.SS "Purpose"
.PP
The motivation to write this plugin is given by the two paths that exist in /etc/fstab: the device file and the mountpoint\&. A missing file is not necessarily an error, because the device file may appear later when a device is plugged in and the mountpoint may be there when another subsequent mount was executed\&. So only warnings are yielded in that case\&. One situation, however, presents an error: Only an absolute path is allowed to occur for both device and mountpoint\&. When checking for relative files, it is not enough to look at the first character if it is a \fC/\fP, because remote file systems and some special names are valid, too\&.
.PP
.SS "Usage"
.PP
If the metakey \fCcheck/path\fP is present, it is checked if the value is a valid absolute file system path\&. If a metavalue is present, an additional check will be done if it is a directory or device file\&.
