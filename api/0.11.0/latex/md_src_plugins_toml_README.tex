This plugin is a storage plugin for reading and writing TOML files. The plugin retains most of the file structure of a read TOML file such as comments, empty lines and TOML tables. It supports all kinds of TOML specific types and tables, including nested inline tables and multiline strings.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md575}{}\doxysection{Requirements}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md575}
The plugin needs Flex ($>$=2.\+6.\+2) and Bison ($>$=3) for parsing TOML files.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md576}{}\doxysection{Types}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md576}
\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md577}{}\doxysubsection{Reading}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md577}
On reading, the plugin will set the {\ttfamily type} metakey for strings, integers, floats and boolean values, if applicable. For decimal integers, the metakey is set to {\ttfamily long\+\_\+long}. For binary/octal/hexadecimal integers, the metakey is set to {\ttfamily unsigned\+\_\+long\+\_\+long}. For floats, the metakey will be set to {\ttfamily double}. These types are chosen to conform with the TOML format as stated on the offical \href{https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0-rc.1}{\texttt{ TOML}} page.

On reading, non-\/decimal integers will get converted to decimal. The non-\/decimal representation will be stored in the {\ttfamily origvalue} metakey of the key. When writing a key, the value of that metakey will be written instead, in order to retain the original format. Note that the {\ttfamily origvalue} metakey gets removed if the value of the key changes.

\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md578}{}\doxysubsection{Writing}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md578}
On writing, for most values, the plugin will infer the appropriate type and will write them accordingly. This means, values, that match a TOML float, integer or date will be written without any quotes around them. If a value does not match any of these types, it will be written as a string.

The plugin uses an existing {\ttfamily type} metakey only to check if it should write a value as a {\ttfamily string} or a {\ttfamily boolean}.

With this functionality, numbers can be written as a string to the file, if wanted.

To write a boolean value, the {\ttfamily type} metakey must be set to {\ttfamily boolean} for the key. Otherwise, no conversion to the TOML boolean values will take place. Per default, Elektra uses 0/1 to represent boolean values.

\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md579}{}\doxysection{Numbers}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md579}
The plugin supports reading and writing of any kind of number supported by the TOML format, such as floating point numbers and binary/octal/decimal/hexadecimal integers. To write a non-\/decimal integer, add the corresponding prefix to the number ({\ttfamily 0b} for binary, {\ttfamily 0o} for octal, {\ttfamily 0x} for hexadecimal). The value will be written in the given base to the file, but converted to decimal within Elektra (see \href{\#\#reading}{\texttt{ Reading}}). Note that the plugin doesn\textquotesingle{}t warn about invalid prefix/digit combinations. If the combination is not valid, it will be written as a string instead.

If the {\ttfamily type} plugin is enabled and you want to change the value of an existing number key which needs conversion (all keys which have a {\ttfamily origvalue}), you have to change the value of {\ttfamily origvalue} instead of the key value. Otherwise the {\ttfamily type} plugin will give an error.

\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md580}{}\doxysection{Strings}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md580}
The plugin can read any kind of TOML string\+: basic, literal, basic multiline and literal multiline.

Similar to the TOML-\/specific values (table, array) discussed below, we use the {\ttfamily tomltype} metakey to store the kind of string. The values used are\+: {\ttfamily string\+\_\+basic}, {\ttfamily string\+\_\+literal}, {\ttfamily string\+\_\+ml\+\_\+basic} and {\ttfamily string\+\_\+ml\+\_\+literal}.

When writing a file, the value of {\ttfamily tomltype} will be respected. The plugin will therefore preserve the kind of string throughout a kdb\+Get/kdb\+Set cycle. You can also set {\ttfamily tomltype} manually to transform the string into a different type. If {\ttfamily tomltype} is set to a kind of string that is incompatible with the current value of the key, the plugin will report an error.

If {\ttfamily tomltype} is not set, the plugin defaults to a basic string, or if there are at least two {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}n} to a basic multiline string. This way a {\ttfamily kdb set} will always work correctly, as long as the given string is valid UTF-\/8.

\end{DoxyCode}


The plugin supports all kinds of escape sequences used by TOML in basic and basic multiline strings, like {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}n}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}r}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}t} and even {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}u}/{\ttfamily \textbackslash{}U} for Unicode escape sequences. When reading a file, all these escape sequences will be translated into valid UTF-\/8 byte sequences that will be used as the key values.

When writing a file, the plugin uses the escape sequences, whenever a part of the key value cannot be placed literally into the file. If a key contains a non-\/\+UTF-\/8 string value, the plugin replaces any invalid sections with the Replacement Character U+\+FFFD and reports a warning.

Finally, the plugin also uses {\ttfamily origvalue} to remember the original formatting of the string. This is particularly useful for escape sequences. Without this mechanism, a {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}u} escape sequence would always be written literally (not as an escape sequence), because when reading the file it is translated into UTF-\/8 bytes. For multiline strings {\ttfamily origvalue} also includes any leading or escaped newlines.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md581}{}\doxysection{Binary/\+NULL values}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md581}
The plugin handles binary values by using the \mbox{\hyperlink{md_src_plugins_base64_README_src_plugins_base64_README_md}{base64}} plugin. As a result, binary values get written as base64 encoded strings, which start with the special prefix {\ttfamily @BASE64}. {\ttfamily NULL} key values are written as special strings of value {\ttfamily @NULL}.

\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md587}{}\doxysection{Comments and Empty Lines}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md587}
The plugin preserves all comments with only one limitation for arrays. The whitespace in front of a comment is also saved.

Comments can also be created by assigning meta keys to a key. The meta keys must be of the form {\ttfamily comment/\#n}, where {\ttfamily n} is a positive number, indicating the position of the comment relative to the key. An index of 0 is always the inline comment of the key. Indices greater than zero are for comments preceding the given key, where 1 is the top-\/most comment and the highest index comment is right above the key.

Preceding whitespace can be added to a comment by creating a {\ttfamily comment/\#n/space} metakey. This metakey can contain any number of space or tab characters, which will be placed before the {\ttfamily \#} starting the comment. Any whitespace {\itshape after} the {\ttfamily \#} is considered part of the comment and will therefore be part of {\ttfamily comment/\#n}.

File ending comments must be assigned to the file root key.

Empty lines in front of a key can be created by adding an empty {\ttfamily comment/\#n/start} entry to it. In this case, no {\ttfamily comment/\#n} key is needed.

Any amount of comments can be placed between array elements or between the first element and the opening brackets.

However, only one comment -\/ an inline comment -\/ can be placed after the last element and the closing brackets. On reading, the plugin discards any non-\/inline comments between the last element and the closing brackets.

\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md589}{}\doxysection{Order}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md589}
The plugin preserves the file order by the usage of the metakey {\ttfamily order}. When reading a file, the order metakey will be set according to the order as read in the file. If new keys are added, eg. via {\ttfamily kdb set}, the order of the set key will be set to the next-\/to-\/highest order value present in the existing key set.

However, the order is only relevant between elements with the same TOML-\/parent. For example keys of a simple table are only sorted with respect to each other, not with any keys outside that table. If that table has it\textquotesingle{}s order changed and moves to another position in the file, so will it\textquotesingle{}s subkeys.

When sorting elements under the same TOML-\/parent, tables (simple and array) will always be sorted after non-\/table elements, regardless of their order. With this limitation, we prevent that a newly set key, that is not part of a certain table array/simple table, would be placed after the table declaration, making it a member of that table on a subsequent read.

In this example, {\ttfamily d} and {\ttfamily common} have the same parent, the file root. This means, they need to be sorted with each other. {\ttfamily d} would be placed before {\ttfamily common} by it\textquotesingle{}s order, since it was set before, and thus, has lesser order. However, their order never gets compared, since {\ttfamily common} is a simple table and {\ttfamily d} is not, so {\ttfamily d} will get sorted before the table regardless of order.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md590}{}\doxysection{Limitations}\label{md_src_plugins_toml_README_autotoc_md590}
While the plugin has good capabilities in handling the TOML file format, it currently lacks some features possible with Elektra\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sparse arrays are not preserved on writing, they get a continuous array without index holes.
\item Values on non-\/leaf keys are currently not supported, they get discarded. This applies especially to the parent key of the mountpoint.
\item Custom metakeys cannot be written by the plugin, so they get discarded.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Additionally, there are some minor limitations related to the TOML file format, mostly related to the preservation of the original file structure\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On writing, each string is written as a TOML basic string (single or multiline). See \href{\#Strings}{\texttt{ Strings}}
\item Comments and newlines between the last array element and closing brackets are discarded.
\item Trailing commas in arrays and inline tables are discarded
\item Only spaces in front of comments are preserved. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
