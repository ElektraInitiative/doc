\end{DoxyItemize}

This plugin is designed to save each line from input as a key. The keys are stored in an array. The key names are determined by the line number such as {\ttfamily \#3} or {\ttfamily \#\+\_\+12} and the value of each key is the infromation stored in that line of the file. The plugin considers {\ttfamily \#0} to be the first line and will automatically add {\ttfamily \+\_\+} to the beginning of key names in order to keep them in numerical order.

For instance, consider the following file name {\ttfamily .config} where the numbers on the left just represent the line numbers\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}1  setting1 true
2  setting2 false
3  setting3 1000
4  #comment
5
6
7  //some other comment
8
9  setting4 -1
10 
\end{DoxyVerb}


This file would result in the following keyset which is being diplayed as {\ttfamily name\+: value}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}#0: setting1 true
#1: setting2 false
#2: setting3 1000
#3: #comment
#4:
#5:
#6: //some other comment
#7:
#8: setting4 -l
#9:
#_10:\end{DoxyVerb}
