\subsection*{Issue}

The compilation variants of plugins blow up the number of plugins. Additionally there is the concept of default storage + resolver that is needed for bootstrapping plugins.

\subsection*{Constraints}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item full default resolver need to be different than other default resolver for testing
\item there is no standard resolver, they always should state their configuration
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Assumptions}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item keep it not too difficult too configure, even though most people will go for the defaults
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Considered Alternatives}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item many C\+Make variables for every case K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+E\+F\+A\+U\+L\+T\+\_\+\+S\+T\+O\+R\+A\+G\+E, K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+E\+F\+A\+U\+L\+T\+\_\+\+R\+E\+S\+O\+L\+V\+E\+R for dynamic and static cases
\item Have a P\+L\+U\+G\+I\+N\+S field that state what is the default dynamic and static plugin, e.\+g. ! for storage ? for resolver ds?resolver\+\_\+b\+\_\+u\+\_\+b;ds!dump
