doc_decisions_4_decided_elektra_malloc_md \- Remove \fBelektraMalloc()\fP et al\&. 
 
.SH "Problem"
.PP
A big problem with having \fCelektraMalloc\fP et al\&.ยน is, that:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
it makes it impossible to call libc functions that allocate data with malloc (e\&.g\&. strndup) or
.IP "\(bu" 2
others that expect a pointer that can be passed to realloc\&.
.PP
.PP
You might even do that by accident and never notice the problem, until someone replaces elektraMalloc and then you could get some pretty bad memory bugs\&.
.PP
ยน Affected functions:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCelektraMalloc\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCelektraCalloc\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCelektraFree\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCelektraStrDup\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCelektraStrLen\fP
.PP
.SH "Constraints"
.PP
Proprietary apps are sometimes delivered together with a libc (either static or a startup script makes sure their own libs are found)\&. If they would use Elektra, and the person wants the app to use the global Elektra it is a valid use case for the dedicated functions\&.
.SH "Assumptions"
.PP
The only safe way to keep elektraMalloc et al\&. is to define that they will always call their libc counterpart (malloc et al\&.) and their purpose is simply to add assertions\&. Then we can also make them private, because you can just call free to free any pointer returned by Elektra\&.
.SH "Considered Alternatives"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Completely replace \fCelektraMalloc\fP / \fCelektraCalloc\fP with simple calls to malloc
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fix all places where non-Elektra functions get used
.PP
.SH "Decision"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
keep current state with the custom functions (allocators)
.IP "\(bu" 2
make it optional for plugin developers to use language specific allocators or our custom allocators
.IP "\(bu" 2
remove everything except \fCelektraFree\fP from public API
.IP "\(bu" 2
remove all functions that don't actually involve any memory allocations (e\&.g\&. \fCelektraStrLen\fP, \fCelektraStrCmp\fP)
.IP "\(bu" 2
add \fCelektraStrNDup\fP and other \fCstdlib\fP equivalents that do memory allocation\&.
.PP
.SH "Rationale"
.PP
While the current state might cause some problems with compiler optimizations and discoverability, those issues probably are only very minor in practice\&. Removing all functions poses a considerable amount of work, which would have to be undone in case we need those functions one day anyway\&. The current downsides don't justify such a big procedure\&.
