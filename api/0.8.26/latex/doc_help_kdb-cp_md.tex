This command copies key(s) in the Key database. You can copy keys to another directory within the database or even below another key. Note that you cannot copy a key below itself.

Where {\ttfamily source} is the path of the key(s) you want to copy and {\ttfamily dest} is the path where you would like to copy the key(s) to. Note that when using the {\ttfamily -\/r} flag, {\ttfamily source} as well as all of the keys below it will be copied.

\subsection*{L\+I\+M\+I\+T\+A\+T\+I\+O\+NS}

Neither {\ttfamily source} nor {\ttfamily dest} can be a cascading key. (Start with {\ttfamily /}). Make sure to select a namespace.

To copy multiple keys\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily kdb cp -\/r user/example1 user/example2}

To copy a single key\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily kdb cp user/example/key1 user/example/key2}

To copy keys below an existing key\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily kdb cp -\/r user/example user/example/key1}~\newline
 Note that in this example, all keys in the example directory will be copied below {\ttfamily key1} {\bfseries except} {\ttfamily key1}.
