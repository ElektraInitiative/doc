See \hyperlink{doc_tutorials_validation_md}{the validation tutorial} for introduction. This plugin provides a conceptual simplistic specification language.

It currently supports to specify\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item structure (which keys are allowed)
\item enums (which values are allowed)
\item multi-\/enums (by name convention\+: if name ends with {\ttfamily $\ast$})
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Purpose}

The plugin demonstrates how simple a configuration specification can be within the Elektra framework. It is conceptual and mainly for educational usage. You can base your plugins

\subsection*{Configuration}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily /keyword/enum}, default {\ttfamily enum}\+: used as keywords for enum definitions.
\item {\ttfamily /keyword/assign}, default {\ttfamily =}\+: used as keywords for assignment.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Configuration within the specification language\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily mountpoint $<$filename$>$}\+: defines a file-\/name for {\ttfamily kdb spec-\/mount}
\item {\ttfamily plugins $<$pluginspec$>$}\+: defines list of plugins for {\ttfamily kdb spec-\/mount}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Usage}

First you need to mount the plugin to spec, e.\+g.\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}kdb mount myspec.ssl spec/test simplespeclang
\end{DoxyVerb}


Then you can write your specification (with default keywords)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cat << HERE > `kdb file spec/test`
mountpoint filename.txt
enum key = value1 value2 value3
enum key2 = value1 value2
HERE
\end{DoxyVerb}


And finally you need a specification mount, so that all necessary plugins are present\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}kdb spec-mount /test
\end{DoxyVerb}


Also make sure that {\ttfamily spec} is mounted as global plugin\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}kdb global-mount
\end{DoxyVerb}


Then you are only able to write valid keys\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}kdb set /test/key value1  # accepted
kdb set /test/key2 value3 # rejected, no value3 for key2
kdb set /test/something else # rejected, no key something\end{DoxyVerb}
