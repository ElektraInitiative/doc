\subsection*{Problem}

Currently, an error or warning message in elektra causes the following line to be shown\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
Ingroup: <group>
\end{DoxyCode}


Its main purpose is to show the user if the error occurred in either {\ttfamily kdb}, {\ttfamily module} or {\ttfamily plugin}.

The problem is that this message is of no value for the user and increases the verbosity of the message.

\subsection*{Constraints}

\subsection*{Assumptions}

\subsection*{Considered Alternatives}

\subsection*{Decision}

The {\ttfamily ingroup} message will be removed as it does not yield any notable benefit.

\subsection*{Rationale}

\subsection*{Implications}

The {\ttfamily ingroup} will be removed from all implementations, metakeys and tests.
