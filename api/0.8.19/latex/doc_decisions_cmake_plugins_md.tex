\subsection*{Issue}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Plugin names and plugin folders not always exactly match (resolver\+\_\+$\ast$, crypto\+\_\+$\ast$)
\item plugin should be able to register new variants
\item there should be only one place to define a new plugin
\item Multiple categories should be possible per plugin, defined in R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md
\item On some O\+S some plugins won't work (simpleini)
\item Some unit tests depend on bindings
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Constraints}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item should work with supported cmake
\item It should be easy to add trivial plugins (without dependency and variants)
\item It should be possible to add complex plugins (with dependencies on plugins/unit tests and many variants)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Assumptions}

\subsection*{Considered Alternatives}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item have one more mapping that describes folder $<$-\/$>$ plugins (bad coherence)
\item directly use R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md to also describe cmake deps (too limited in expression)
\item split up Add\+Plugin.\+cmake and C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt (does not work well with variants)
\item simply adding all directories in src/plugins and decide within the {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugin} if we should drop the plugin (see below in Argument)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Names for flag\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily D\+E\+P\+E\+N\+D\+E\+N\+C\+I\+E\+S} -\/$>$ might be used for {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugin}
\item {\ttfamily A\+S\+S\+E\+M\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+P\+S}
\item {\ttfamily F\+I\+N\+D\+\_\+\+D\+E\+P\+S} -\/$>$ not only finding happens
\item {\ttfamily P\+R\+O\+C\+E\+S\+S\+\_\+\+D\+E\+P\+S}
\item {\ttfamily H\+A\+N\+D\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+P\+S}
\item {\ttfamily D\+E\+P\+S\+\_\+\+M\+O\+D\+E} -\/$>$ too generic, new terminology
\item {\ttfamily C\+H\+E\+C\+K\+\_\+\+D\+E\+P\+S} -\/$>$ not only checking happens
\item {\ttfamily D\+O\+\_\+\+D\+E\+P\+S} -\/$>$ sounds funny
\item {\ttfamily F\+I\+N\+D\+\_\+\+P\+A\+C\+K\+A\+G\+E\+S} -\/$>$ not only packages are subject to this phase
\item {\ttfamily C\+O\+L\+L\+E\+C\+T} -\/$>$ needs N\+O\+T
\item {\ttfamily F\+I\+N\+D\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+S\+E} -\/$>$ needs N\+O\+T
\item {\ttfamily D\+E\+P\+E\+N\+D\+E\+N\+C\+Y} -\/$>$ ambiguous
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Decision}

Introduce a cmake process where all plugins are processed three times. Following cmake variables are used for the phases\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily C\+O\+L\+L\+E\+C\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+S\+E} .. collect all {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugins}
\item {\ttfamily D\+E\+P\+E\+N\+D\+E\+N\+C\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+S\+E} .. resolve all dependencies, do {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugins} again
\item {\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+T\+E\+S\+T\+I\+N\+G\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+S\+E} .. (reserve for potential 3rd phase)
\end{DoxyItemize}

1.) Collection phase ({\ttfamily C\+O\+L\+L\+E\+C\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+S\+E} is {\ttfamily O\+N}), add\+\_\+plugin internally builds up\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+E\+D\+\_\+\+P\+L\+U\+G\+I\+N\+S}
\item {\ttfamily R\+E\+M\+O\+V\+E\+D\+\_\+\+P\+L\+U\+G\+I\+N\+S}
\item {\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+E\+D\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\+E\+C\+T\+O\+R\+I\+E\+S} 2.) assemble dependency phase ({\ttfamily D\+E\+P\+E\+N\+D\+E\+N\+C\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+S\+E} is {\ttfamily O\+N}, only considering {\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+E\+D\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\+E\+C\+T\+O\+R\+I\+E\+S}), with\+:
\item find\+\_\+libraries, actually search for libraries on the system (only relevant libraries of plugins that are considered for inclusion)
\item add\+\_\+plugin, with {\itshape actually adding} the plugins 3.) assemble all unit tests ({\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+T\+E\+S\+T\+I\+N\+G\+\_\+\+P\+H\+A\+S\+E} is {\ttfamily O\+N}), either
\item with {\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T} in {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugin}, or
\item with {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugintest} (for unittests that have dependencies to bindings)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Argument}

Solves all the issues without adding too much complexity for actually adding plugins.

Maintaining additional mappings is very time-\/consuming. Simply adding all plugins directories is problematic. It would\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item clutter the cmake output (especially in the case of errors)
\item introduce more variables into the C\+Make\+Cache which are irrelevant for the user
\item maybe even find libraries in wrong versions which are incompatible to what other plugins need
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Implications}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item need to adopt all C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Limitations}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+E\+D\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\+E\+C\+T\+O\+R\+I\+E\+S} of variants will be kept
\item Typos in plugin names are currently not checked, strings that are not plugin names are simply ignored.
