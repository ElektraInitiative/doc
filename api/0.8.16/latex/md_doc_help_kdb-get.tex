{\ttfamily kdb get $<$path$>$}

Where {\ttfamily path} is the full path to the key.

\subsection*{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N}

This command is used to retrieve the value of a key.

If you enter a {\ttfamily path} starting with a leading {\ttfamily /}, then a cascading lookup will be performed in order to attempt to locate the key. In this case, using the {\ttfamily -\/v} option allows the user to see the full {\ttfamily path} of the key if it is found.

Note\+: There is a current limitation where only keys that are mounted will be considered during a cascading lookup. A workaround that will lookup all keys is to pass the {\ttfamily -\/a} option. Additionally, a user can use the command {\ttfamily kdb ls $<$same key$>$} to see if an override or a fallback will be considered by the lookup.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/\+H}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/help}\+: Show the man page.
\item {\ttfamily -\/\+V}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/version}\+: Print version info.
\item {\ttfamily -\/p}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/profile}=$<$profile$>$\+: Use a different kdb profile.
\item {\ttfamily -\/a}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/all}\+: Consider all of the keys.
\item {\ttfamily -\/n}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/no-\/newline}\+: Suppress the newline at the end of the output.
\item {\ttfamily -\/v}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/verbose}\+: Explain what is happening. Gives a complete trace of all tried keys. Very useful to debug fallback and overrides.

To get the value of a key\+: {\ttfamily kdb get user/example/key}

To get the value of a key using a cascading lookup\+: {\ttfamily kdb get /example/key}

To get the value of a key without adding a newline to the end of it\+: {\ttfamily kdb get -\/n /example/key}

To explain why a specific key was used (for cascading keys)\+: {\ttfamily kdb get -\/v /example/key}

To use bookmarks\+: {\ttfamily kdb get +kdb/format}

This command will actually get {\ttfamily user/sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/current/format} if the bookmarks commands from \hyperlink{md_doc_help_kdb-set_doc_help_kdb-set_md}{kdb-\/set(1)} man pages are executed before.
