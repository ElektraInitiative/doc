We are proud to release Elektra 0.\+9.\+1.

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database. For more information, visit \href{https://libelektra.org}{\texttt{ https\+://libelektra.\+org}}.

You can also read the news \href{https://www.libelektra.org/news/0.9.1-release}{\texttt{ on our website}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Code generation
\item Elektra now has a technical preview of a new \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_tutorials_cmerge_md}{merge library}} offering a number of \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_help_elektra-cmerge-strategy_md}{merge strategies}}. It is written in C99 and can currently be used with \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_help_kdb-cmerge_md}{\`{}kdb cmerge\`{}}}. \+\_\+(Dominic Jäger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

While the new {\ttfamily kdb gen} was already included in the last release, it is now fully functional and ready for productive use. To get started take a look at the new man-\/page for \href{https://www.libelektra.org/manpages/kdb-gen}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily kdb-\/gen(1)}}}.

If you specifically want to use it with the High-\/\+Level A\+PI take a look at \href{https://www.libelektra.org/tutorials/high-level-api}{\texttt{ this tutorial}}.

We also created a new C\+Make function that will be available, if you include Elektra via C\+Make\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package}. The function is called {\ttfamily elektra\+\_\+kdb\+\_\+gen} and can be used to tell C\+Make about files that are generated via {\ttfamily kdb gen}. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+

The following section lists news about the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme}{\texttt{ modules}} we updated in this release.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We removed 12 obsolete or unfinished plugins\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily boolean},
\item {\ttfamily cachefilter},
\item {\ttfamily cpptype},
\item {\ttfamily dini},
\item {\ttfamily enum},
\item {\ttfamily regexstore},
\item {\ttfamily required},
\item {\ttfamily haskell},
\item {\ttfamily simplespeclang},
\item {\ttfamily regexdispatcher},
\item {\ttfamily typechecker},
\item {\ttfamily struct}. \+\_\+(Markus Raab, René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item We unified the name of the config check function of the plugins to {\ttfamily name\+Of\+Plugin\+Check\+Conf}. Before this update some plugins used the name {\ttfamily name\+Of\+Plugin\+Check\+Config} instead. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item We improved the error messages in {\ttfamily crypto}, {\ttfamily fcrypt}, and {\ttfamily gpgme} plugins. \+\_\+(\+Peter Nirschl)\+\_\+
\item Handle return codes (error codes) of {\ttfamily execv} in the G\+PG module. \+\_\+(\+Peter Nirschl)\+\_\+
\item Improved the documentation of {\ttfamily ks\+Append\+Key} regarding ownership of keys. \+\_\+(\+Raphael Gruber)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

We removed the experimental plugin. For a plugin that is able to parse similar syntax, please take a look at the


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{autotoc_md726_src_plugins_yajl_README_md}{Y\+A\+JL}} , and
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{autotoc_md780_src_plugins_yamlcpp_README_md}{Y\+A\+ML C\+PP}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

plugins. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The error message, if non of the gopts variants can be compiled, was improved. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item A better error, if the plugin fails to load {\ttfamily argv} from the system, was added. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item A function to detect help mode, without invoking {\ttfamily elektra\+Get\+Opts} was added. It simply checks, whether {\ttfamily -\/-\/help} is one of the string in {\ttfamily argv}. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item Increase test timeout from 120s to 240s. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We added a plugin which can be used to parse kconfig ini files into a keyset and save keysets to such files. \+\_\+(\+Dardan Haxhimustafa)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We now store the O\+P\+M\+P\+HM inside of the mmap format. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item The storage format was changed and many sanity checks were improved or added. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Enforce consistency by writing the magic file footer last. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Filter empty meta Key\+Sets to save space. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugin now correctly sets the path in the {\ttfamily parent\+Key}. It therefore now supports set calls. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \href{https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/shell_recorder/tutorial_wrapper}{\texttt{ Markdown Shell Recorder}} test of the plugin now also works, if you execute it as root user. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There is now the config key {\ttfamily missing/log} that allows logging of all missing {\ttfamily require}d keys. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily spec} now internally handles errors differently. There should be no external impact apart from better performance. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We now treat relative paths as relative to {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+B\+\_\+\+S\+P\+EC} instead of the current working directory. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item Changes to {\ttfamily default} or {\ttfamily type} metadata are no longer supported, since they are not safe in every case. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The plugin no longer has the {\ttfamily experimental} status. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We made sure that building the plugin works, if you use the latest version of C\+Make ({\ttfamily 3.\+15.\+3}) and Boost ({\ttfamily 1.\+71}). \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We added an option to disable the restoring of boolean values. This useful for storage formats like Y\+A\+ML that have native boolean types. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Yajl now correctly supports Elektras boolean types using the {\ttfamily type} plugin. For example, setting {\ttfamily on}, {\ttfamily enable} or {\ttfamily true} all map to J\+S\+O\+Ns native {\ttfamily true} value. See the \mbox{\hyperlink{autotoc_md695_src_plugins_type_README_md}{type}} plugin for more details about boolean types. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We removed the plugin in favor of \mbox{\hyperlink{autotoc_md861_src_plugins_yanlr_README_md}{Yan LR}}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We removed the plugin in favor of \mbox{\hyperlink{autotoc_md861_src_plugins_yanlr_README_md}{Yan LR}}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

The text below summarizes updates to the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme}{\texttt{ C (and C++)-\/based libraries}} of Elektra.

We introduced several incompatible changes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The library {\ttfamily libelektra}, which is a collection of different elektra libraries, is now removed. Users of C\+Make or pkg-\/config should not be affected. Otherwise change {\ttfamily -\/lelektra} to {\ttfamily -\/lelektra-\/core -\/lelektra-\/kdb} or whatever parts of Elektra your application uses. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item The conversion functions {\ttfamily elektra\+Key\+To$\ast$} and {\ttfamily elektra$\ast$\+To\+String} are now part of the {\ttfamily elektra-\/ease} library instead of the {\ttfamily elektra-\/highlevel} library. This should not cause any breaking changes since {\ttfamily elektra-\/highlevel} already depends on {\ttfamily elektra-\/ease}. In addition the header {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{conversion_8h}{elektra/conversion.\+h}}} is kept for compatibility. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item Fixes in documentation that might disallow some code operating in grey areas before. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item We removed {\ttfamily key\+Rel} and {\ttfamily key\+Rel2} since it can be easily replaced by other existing functions. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

We changed the following symbols\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+P\+L\+U\+G\+I\+N\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+M\+IT

\item kdb\+\_\+double\+\_\+t
\item kdb\+\_\+long\+\_\+double\+\_\+t
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A new plugin function, {\ttfamily kdb\+Commit}, was implemented. The function is carried out in the {\ttfamily commit} phase of {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} and separates the commit functionality from the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga11436b058408f83d303ca5e996832bcf}{kdb\+Set()}}} function. \+\_\+(\+Vid Leskovar)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdbconfig.\+h} is no longer included in the installed headers. This is because it could cause conflicts with other {\ttfamily config.\+h}-\/type headers from applications. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily ks\+Append\+Key}\+: state that it only fail on memory problems. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Fix memory leak in {\ttfamily kdb\+Get}. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Implemented {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{kdberrors_8h}{kdberrors.\+h}}} directly without generation of the {\ttfamily specification} file because of drastically reduced error code count \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily key\+Is\+Direct\+Below} was renamed to {\ttfamily key\+Is\+Directly\+Below}. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily key\+Meta} was added to provide access to a key\textquotesingle{}s underlying Key\+Set that holds its metadata keys. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item Removed the obsolete {\ttfamily ks\+Lookup\+By\+String} and {\ttfamily ks\+Lookup\+By\+Binary}, as well as deprecated {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+O\+\_\+$\ast$} options. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item Added {\ttfamily key\+Lock} and {\ttfamily key\+Is\+Locked}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item Removed {\ttfamily key\+V\+Init}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The option {\ttfamily -\/h} is no longer used to indicate help mode. Only {\ttfamily -\/-\/help}, will invoke help mode. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed or moved several functions of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{kdbproposal_8h}{kdbproposal.\+h}}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily elektra\+Ks\+To\+Mem\+Array} was moved to {\ttfamily kdbease.\+h},
\item {\ttfamily elektra\+Lookup\+Options} was moved to {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{kdbprivate_8h}{kdbprivate.\+h}}},
\item {\ttfamily key\+Set\+StringF} was moved to {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{kdbinternal_8h}{kdbinternal.\+h}}},
\item Removed {\ttfamily ks\+Prev} and {\ttfamily elektra\+Ks\+Prev},
\item Removed {\ttfamily elektra\+Rename\+Keys} and replaced it with {\ttfamily ks\+Rename\+Keys}. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using \href{https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme}{\texttt{ various programming languages}}. This section keeps you up to date with the multi-\/language support provided by Elektra.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Warnings about cmake policies are avoided. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item We removed the Haskell and GI bindings. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Avoid unnecessary copying std\+::string where possible (set\+String and set\+Meta only). \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item C\+PP\+: add {\ttfamily Key\+::is\{Name,Value,Meta\}Locked}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item G\+L\+IB\+: removed {\ttfamily gelektra\+\_\+keyset\+\_\+resize}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item G\+L\+IB\+: removed {\ttfamily gelektra\+\_\+keyset\+\_\+rewind}, {\ttfamily gelektra\+\_\+keyset\+\_\+next}, {\ttfamily gelektra\+\_\+keyset\+\_\+current}, {\ttfamily gelektra\+\_\+keyset\+\_\+getcursor}, {\ttfamily gelektra\+\_\+keyset\+\_\+setcursor}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item G\+L\+IB\+: renamed {\ttfamily gelektra\+\_\+keyset\+\_\+atcursor} to {\ttfamily gelektra\+\_\+keyset\+\_\+at}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item gsettings\+: adapt iterator. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item S\+W\+IG\+: Add {\ttfamily Key\+Not\+Found\+Exception} exception. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item S\+W\+IG\+: Fix Key\+Set equality operators. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item S\+W\+I\+G/\+Python\+: {\ttfamily hash(key)} will throw unless the key name is locked. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item S\+W\+I\+G/\+Python\+: Add operator overloadings for {\ttfamily len(\+Key)}, {\ttfamily repr(\+Key)}, {\ttfamily str(\+Key\+Set)}, {\ttfamily repr(\+Key\+Set)}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item S\+W\+I\+G/\+Python\+: Add alternative Key constructor {\ttfamily Key(name, value, \mbox{[}dict\mbox{]})}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item S\+W\+I\+G/\+Python\+: Add {\ttfamily Key\+Set.\+extend(\mbox{[}key1, key2,...\mbox{]})} and {\ttfamily Key\+Set.\+append(key1, key2, ...)}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item S\+W\+I\+G/\+Python\+: Add {\ttfamily Key\+Set.\+append(key\+\_\+name, key\+\_\+value, key\+\_\+opts)} which directly creates and appends a key. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\item S\+W\+I\+G/\+Python\+: Add {\ttfamily Key\+Set.\+unpack\+\_\+names()}, {\ttfamily Key\+Set.\+unpack\+\_\+basenames()}, {\ttfamily Key\+Set.\+filter(func)}, {\ttfamily Key\+Set.\+filter\+\_\+below(where)}, {\ttfamily Key.\+array\+\_\+elements()}. \+\_\+(\+Manuel Mausz)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Upgraded maven dependencies for Java binding \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\item Completely overhauled the Java binding to be able to use Elektra plugins directly. A new Plugin\+Loader can load Elektra plugins or a native implemented Java plugin. All Plugins now implement the new Plugin interface. For an example see the test case. \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\item The java binding now supports the \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_decisions_error_codes_md}{error codes}} in a native way. All exceptions contain the necessary information. \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\item Further improved the java binding such as wording and documentation. \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add the {\ttfamily elektra-\/sys} crate which contains raw bindings to libelektra for Rust. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item Add the {\ttfamily elektra} crate which contains safe wrapper methods for the raw bindings. The crate contains bindings for the low-\/level A\+PI, which means that the data types {\ttfamily Key} and {\ttfamily Key\+Set} can now safely be used from Rust. The Rust version of the A\+PI has been designed to take advantage of Rust\textquotesingle{}s type system and to be in accordance with the memory safety of Rust. For instance, the Key has been divided into {\ttfamily String\+Key} and {\ttfamily Binary\+Key}, to prevent type mismatches at compile time. With the binding for {\ttfamily K\+DB}, one can take advantage of the elektra ecosystem from Rust. See the Readme for more. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item The \href{https://crates.io/crates/elektra}{\texttt{ elektra}} and \href{https://crates.io/crates/elektra-sys}{\texttt{ elektra-\/sys}} crates have been published to crates.\+io for easier usage. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item Rewrote the {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+Error} to follow the specification fully and in particular allow catching out of memory errors by catching resource errors. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item Added a {\ttfamily keyset!} macro to easily create a keyset with many keys in a single invocation. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+E\+X\+E\+C\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH}, which can be used to add further external tools to {\ttfamily kdb}, now supports {\ttfamily \+:} to separate paths. {\ttfamily kdb list-\/tools} and {\ttfamily run\+\_\+env} were improved to take advantage of this. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Checks for {\ttfamily kdb\+Commit} have been added to \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_help_kdb-plugin-check_md}{kdb plugin-\/check}}. \+\_\+(\+Vid Leskovar)\+\_\+
\item add P\+ID file config setting for kdb-\/run-\/rest-\/frontend \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Added {\ttfamily kdb meta-\/show} command which prints out all metadata along with its values for a given key. \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\item Removed {\ttfamily kdb vset} as it does not properly put meta-\/data to the spec namespace. \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\item Renamed kdb plugin commands following a hierarchical structure. {\ttfamily kdb info} is now {\ttfamily kdb plugin-\/info}, {\ttfamily kdb check} is now {\ttfamily kdb plugin-\/check} and {\ttfamily kdb list} is now {\ttfamily kdb plugin-\/list}. We also removed the obsolete {\ttfamily kdb fstab}. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item Renamed kdb meta commands\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily kdb getmeta} is now {\ttfamily kdb meta-\/get}
\item {\ttfamily kdb lsmeta} is now {\ttfamily kdb meta-\/ls}
\item {\ttfamily kdb showmeta} is now {\ttfamily kdb meta-\/show}
\item {\ttfamily kdb rmmeta} is now {\ttfamily kdb meta-\/rm}
\item {\ttfamily kdb setmeta} is now {\ttfamily kdb meta-\/set} \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix test tool {\ttfamily gen-\/gpg-\/testkey} by giving a narrower G\+PG key description. Fixes mismatches with existing G\+PG keys that contain \char`\"{}elektra.\+org\char`\"{} as e-\/mail address. \+\_\+(\+Peter Nirschl)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb list-\/commands} and {\ttfamily kdb plugins-\/list} now sort their output in an alphabetical order \+\_\+(Anton Hößl)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb plugin-\/list} does now mention in the helptext that with option {\ttfamily -\/v} the output is sorted by the plugin status \+\_\+(Anton Hößl)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb import}, {\ttfamily kdb export} and {\ttfamily kdb editor} now search the plugin database for suitig plugins so it\textquotesingle{}s now possible to run {\ttfamily kdb export /hello json} instead of having to specify the plugin for the desired format directly. \+\_\+(Anton Hößl)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily get} and {\ttfamily mount}\+: Remove dependency on {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{kdbprivate_8h}{kdbprivate.\+h}}} \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We structured the \mbox{\hyperlink{scripts_README_md}{scripts}}. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+

\item {\ttfamily example-\/xorg}. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The script run\+\_\+icheck now also work correctly, if the last entry of \`{}icheck.suppression\`{} does not end with a newline character. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item Renamed {\ttfamily scripts/run\+\_\+dev\+\_\+env} to {\ttfamily scripts/dev/run\+\_\+env}. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item The script \`{}draw-\/all-\/plugins\`{} now also works properly, if the repository path contains space characters. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The script \`{}link-\/checker\`{} now deduplicates the list of links before checking them. The timeout and amount of retries was also reduced. Lastly the script now supports a whitelist. Any link stored in \`{}tests/linkchecker.whitelist\`{} will not be checked. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item We removed a script used to compare the runtime performance of Y\+A\+ML plugins. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item Cleanup\+: separation of dev, admin and completion scripts. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab, Rene Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item Pre-\/commit hook {\ttfamily pre-\/commit-\/check-\/formatting} now lives in \`{}scripts/dev/pre-\/commit-\/check-\/formatting\`{}. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The new script reformat-\/javascript formats the Java\+Script code of the repository using the tool \href{https://prettier.io}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily prettier}}}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item We renamed
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the script {\ttfamily reformat-\/source} to {\ttfamily reformat-\/c}, and
\item the script {\ttfamily reformat-\/shfmt} to {\ttfamily reformat-\/shell}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The script cmake-\/format now requires {\ttfamily cmake-\/format} 0.\+6. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The new script reformat-\/java formats the Java code in the repository using \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily clang-\/format}}}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix T\+O\+D\+Os. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item The \href{https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/shell_recorder/tutorial_wrapper}{\texttt{ Markdown Shell Recorder}} now also works correctly on Free\+B\+SD. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

The website is generated from the repository, so all information about plugins, bindings and tools are always up to date. Furthermore, we changed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The website now lives in the folders website-\/frontend and website-\/backend to avoid confusion with the R\+E\+ST backend of the Web-\/\+UI. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Improve mainpage of website, restructure getting started. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Renamed the sub menu {\itshape Getting Started} in the menu {\itshape Documentation} to {\itshape About Elektra} and removed the sub-\/sub-\/menus {\itshape Compiling}, {\itshape Installation} and {\itshape Tutorials}. These sub-\/sub-\/menus are now sub-\/menus of {\itshape Documentation}. A new sub menu labeled {\itshape Get Started} added to the menu {\itshape Documentation} with some newcomer-\/friendly informations. Renamed the {\itshape Getting Started} sub menu in {\itshape Development} to {\itshape Contribute to Elektra}. The green button on the main page is routed to the new {\itshape Get Started} page. \+\_\+(\+Hani Torabi)\+\_\+
\item Improve main page of website, restructure getting started. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

We are currently working on following topics\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Merge tool in C99 (the same language as the core of Elektra). This is planned to supersede the existing merge tool. The goal is to reduce the number of merge conflicts in contrast to regular merge tools using the specific semantics of configuration files. \+\_\+(Dominic Jäger)\+\_\+

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/ftp/elektra/publications/boeswirth2019highlevel.pdf}{\texttt{ Klemens Böswirth}}\+: We explore the feasibility of using Elektra in a real-\/world project. We focused especially on using the high-\/level A\+PI with code-\/generation. In the thesis, we implemented new versions of L\+C\+Dproc, one with the low-\/level A\+PI and one with the high-\/level A\+PI. Then we did some benchmarks to compare them. Our results indicate, that Elektra is very much usable in real-\/world projects. However, we also found that there is still potential for further optimizations.
