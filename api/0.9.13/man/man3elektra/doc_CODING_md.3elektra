.SH NAME
doc_CODING_md \- CODING 
 This document provides an introduction in how the source code of libelektra is organized and how and where to add functionality\&.
.SH "Folder structure"
.PP
After you downloaded and unpacked Elektra you should see some folders\&. The most important are:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBsrc:\fP This directory contains the source of the libraries, tools and plugins\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdoc:\fP General documentation for the project and the core library\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBexamples:\fP Examples on how to use the core library\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBtests:\fP Contains the testing framework for the source (\fBsrc\fP)\&.
.PP
.PP
You can find more information about the structure in the \fCREADME\&.md\fP\&.
.SH "General Information"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Make sure that the codestyle of contributions complies with the already established codestyle of this project, except if this document says otherwise: then please open an issue for offending code\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
We use Unix line endings
.IP "\(bu" 2
Large files should be in https://blobs.libelektra.org/ or https://rawdata.libelektra.org
.IP "\(bu" 2
`find \&. -not -regex '[/\&.a-zA-Z0-9_-]*'` should not find your file names
.PP
.SH "Source Code"
.PP
The same guidelines apply to all code in the repository including the plugins\&.
.SS "General Guidelines"
You are only allowed to break a guideline if there is a good reason to do so\&. When you do, document the fact as comment next to the code\&.
.PP
Of course, all rules of good software engineering apply: Use meaningful names and keep the software both testable and reusable\&.
.PP
The purpose of the guidelines is to have a consistent style, not to teach programming\&.
.PP
If you see code that breaks guidelines do not hesitate to fix them or at least open issues\&.
.PP
If you see inconsistency within the rules do not hesitate to open an issue about it\&.
.SS "Code Comments"
Code is not only for the computer, but it should be readable for humans, too\&. Up-to-date code comments are essential to make code understandable for others\&. Thus please use following techniques (in order of preference):
.PP
.IP "1." 4
Comment functions with \fC/**/\fP and Doxygen, see below\&.
.IP "2." 4
You should also add assertions to state what should be true at a specific position in the code\&. Their syntax is checked and they are automatically verified at run-time\&. So they are not only useful for people reading the code but also for tools\&. Assertions in Elektra are used by:
.PP
\fC#include <\fBkdbassert\&.h\fP>\fP
.PP
\fCELEKTRA_ASSERT (condition, 'formatted text to be printed when assert fails', \&.\&.\&.)\fP
.PP
Note: Do not use assert for user-APIs, always handle arguments of user-APIs like untrusted input\&.
.IP "3." 4
If the 'comment' might be useful to be printed during execution, use logging:
.PP
\fC#include <\fBkdblogger\&.h\fP>\fP
.PP
\fCELEKTRA_LOG ('formatted text to be printed according to log filters', \&.\&.\&.)\fP
.PP
Read \fBHERE\fP for how to enable the logger\&.
.IP "4." 4
Otherwise comment within source with \fC//\fP or with \fC/**/\fP for multi-line comments\&. Use \fCTODO\fP to indicate that something is not yet done\&. Before merging, relevant \fCTODO\fPs should be fixed or \fCissues\fP created for left-overs\&.
.PP
.SS "Coding Style"
.IP "\(bu" 2
Limits
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Functions should not exceed 100 lines\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Files should not exceed 1000 lines\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
A line should not be longer than 140 characters\&.
.PP
.PP
Split up when those limits are reached\&. Rationale: Readability with split windows\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Indentation
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Use tabs for indentation\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
One tab equals 8 spaces\&.
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Blocks
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Use blocks even for single line statements\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Curly braces go on a line on their own on the previous indentation level\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Avoid multiple variable declarations at one place\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Declare Variables as late as possible, preferable within blocks\&.
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Naming
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Use camelCase for functions and variables\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Start types with upper-case, everything else with lower-case\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Prefix names with \fCelektra\fP for internal usage\&. External API either starts with \fCks\fP, \fCkey\fP or \fCkdb\fP\&.
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Whitespaces
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Use space before and after equal when assigning a value\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Use space before round parenthesis ( \fC(\fP )\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Use space before and after \fC*\fP from Pointers\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Use space after \fC,\fP of every function argument\&.
.PP

.PP
.PP
The \fBreformat script\fP can ensure most code style rules, but it is obviously not capable of ensuring everything (e\&.g\&. naming conventions)\&. So do not give this responsibility out of hands entirely\&. You can \fBuse docker\fP to ensure that you have the correct version of all our reformatting tools at hand\&. You can also enable that formatting runs automatically before commiting using \fCscripts/dev/enable-pre-commit-hook\fP and disable it again using \fCscripts/dev/disable-pre-commit-hook\fP
.SS "C Guidelines"
.IP "\(bu" 2
The compiler shall not emit any warning (or error)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Use goto only for error situations\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Use \fCconst\fP as much as possible\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Use \fCstatic\fP methods if they should not be externally visible\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
C-Files have extension \fC\&.c\fP, Header files \fC\&.h\fP\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Use internal functions: prefer to use \fCelektraMalloc\fP, \fCelektraFree\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
\fBExample:\fP \fCsrc/libs/elektra/kdb\&.c\fP
.SS "Clang Format"
To guarantee consistent formatting we use \fC\fCclang-format\fP\fP (version \fC12\fP) to format all C and C++ code in the repository\&. Since our build servers also check the style for every pull request you might want to make sure you reformat your C/C++ code changes with this tool\&.
.PP
To find out which version of \fCclang-format\fP a certain build server uses please check:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
the \fBDebian sid Docker image\fP,
.IP "\(bu" 2
the \fBGitHub Actions configuration files\fP, and
.IP "\(bu" 2
the \fBCirrus configuration file\fP
.PP
.PP
and search for the relevant packages (\fCclang-format\fP, \fCllvm\fP)\&. Currently we use clang-format \fC12\fP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
in the \fBGitHub Actions configuration files\fP,
.IP "\(bu" 2
in the \fBDebian sid Docker container\fP on the Jenkins build server, and
.IP "\(bu" 2
in the \fBCirrus macOS\fP build jobs\&.
.PP
.SS "Installation"
.SS "macOS"
.PP
On macOS you can install \fCclang-format\fP using \fCHomebrew\fP either directly:
.PP
.PP
.nf
brew install clang-format
.fi
.PP
.PP
or by installing the whole \fCLLVM\fP infrastructure:
.PP
.PP
.nf
brew install llvm
.fi
.PP
.PP
Please note, that both of these commands will install current versions of \fCclang-format\fP that might format code a little bit differently than Clang-Format \fC12\fP in certain edge cases\&. If you want you can also install a specific version of LLVM and Clang-Format: e\&.g\&. Clang-Format \fC11\fP using LLVM \fC11\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
brew install llvm@11
.fi
.PP
.PP
.SS "Debian"
.PP
In Debian (Sid) the package for Clang-Format \fC12\fP is called \fCclang-format-12\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
apt-get install clang-format-12
.fi
.PP
.SS "Usage"
For the basic use cases you can use \fCclang-format\fP directly\&. To do that, just call the tool using the option \fC-i\fP and specify the name of the files you want to reformat\&. For example, if you want to reformat the file \fC\fBsrc/bindings/cpp/include/kdb\&.hpp\fP\fP you can use the following command:
.PP
.PP
.nf
# On some systems such as Debian the `clang-format` executable also contains
# the version number\&. For those systems, please replace `clang-format`,
# with `clang-format-12` in the command below\&.
clang-format -i src/bindings/cpp/include/kdb\&.hpp
.fi
.PP
.PP
While this works fine, if you want to format only a small number of file, formatting multiple files can be quite tedious\&. For that purpose you can use the script \fB`reformat-c`\fP that reformats all C and C++ code in Elektra’s code base
.PP
.PP
.nf
scripts/dev/reformat-c # This script will probably take some seconds to execute
.fi
.PP
.SS "Tool Integration"
If you work on Elektra’s code base regularly you might want to integrate the formatting step directly in your development setup\&. \fCClangFormat’s homepage\fP includes a list of integrations for various tools that should help you to do that\&. Even if this webpage does not list any integrations for your favorite editor or IDE, you can usually add support for external tools such as \fCclang-format\fP to advanced editors or IDEs pretty easily\&.
.PP
.SS "TextMate"
.PP
While \fCTextMate\fP supports \fCclang-format\fP for the current file directly via the keyboard shortcut \fCctrl\fP+\fC⇧\fP+\fCH\fP, the editor does not automatically reformat the file on save\&. To do that
.PP
.IP "1." 4
open the bundle editor (“Bundles” → “Edit Bundles”),
.IP "2." 4
navigate to the “Reformat Code” item of the C bundle (“C” → “Menu Actions” → “Reformat Code”),
.IP "3." 4
insert \fCcallback\&.document\&.will-save\fP into the field “Semantic Class”, and
.IP "4." 4
change the menu option for the field “Save” to “Nothing”
.PP
.PP
After that change TextMate will reformat C and C++ code with \fCclang-format\fP every time you save a file\&.
.SS "C++ Guidelines"
.IP "\(bu" 2
Everything as in C if not noted otherwise\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Do not use goto at all, use RAII instead\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Do not use raw pointers, use smart pointers instead\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
C++-Files have extension \fC\&.cpp\fP, Header files \fC\&.hpp\fP\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Do not use \fCstatic\fP, but anonymous namespaces\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Write everything within namespaces and do not prefix names\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Oriented towards \fCmore safe and modern usage\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
\fBExample:\fP \fCsrc/bindings/cpp/include/kdb\&.hpp\fP
.SS "CMake Guidelines"
We use a similar style for CMake as we do for other code:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
The length of a functions should not exceed 100 lines\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The length of a file should not exceed 1000 lines\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
A line should not be longer than 140 characters\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Use tabs for indentation\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
One tab equals 8 spaces\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Declare variables as late as possible, preferable within blocks\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add a space character before round parenthesis ( \fC(\fP )\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Use lower case for command names (e\&.g\&. \fCset\fP instead of \fCSET\fP)
.PP
.SS "CMake format"
We use \fC\fCcmake-format\fP\fP to reformat code according to the guidelines given above\&. Since \fCcmake-format\fP currently does not support tabs, we use the standard command \fCunexpand\fP to fix this issue\&. For example, to reformat the file \fCCMakeLists\&.txt\fP in the root folder of the repository we use the following command:
.PP
.PP
.nf
# This command uses `sponge`, which is part of the [moreutils](https://joeyh\&.name/code/moreutils/) package\&.
cmake-format CMakeLists\&.txt | unexpand | sponge CMakeLists\&.txt
.fi
.PP
.SS "Installation"
Since \fCcmake-format\fP is written in \fCPython\fP you usually install it via Python’s package manager \fCpip\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
# Install cmakelang `0\&.6\&.13` with support for YAML config files
pip install cmakelang[yaml]==0\&.6\&.13
.fi
.PP
.PP
Please make sure, that you install the correct version (\fC0\&.6\&.13\fP) of cmake-format:
.PP
.PP
.nf
cmake-format --version
#> 0\&.6\&.13
.fi
.PP
.PP
since otherwise the formatted code might look quite different\&.
.PP
We also use the \fCmoreutils\fP in our \fBCMake formatting script\fP, which you can install on macOS using \fCHomebrew\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
brew install moreutils
.fi
.PP
.PP
and on Debian using \fCapt-get\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
apt-get install moreutils
.fi
.PP
.SS "Usage"
If you want to reformat the whole codebase you can use the script \fB`reformat-cmake`\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
scripts/dev/reformat-cmake # Running this script for the whole code base takes some time\&.
.fi
.PP
.PP
To reformat specific files add a list of file paths after the command:
.PP
.PP
.nf
# The command below reformats the file `cmake/CMakeLists\&.txt`\&.
scripts/dev/reformat-cmake cmake/CMakeLists\&.txt
.fi
.PP
.SS "Tool Integration"
If you work on CMake code quite often you probably want to integrate cmake-format into your development workflow\&. The homepage of \fCcmake-format\fP list some integration options\&.
.PP
.SS "TextMate"
.PP
While TextMate does not support cmake-format directly, you can quickly create a command that applies \fCcmake-format\fP every time you save a CMake file yourself\&. The steps below show one option to do that\&.
