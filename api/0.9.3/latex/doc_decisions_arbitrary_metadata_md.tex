To make storage-\/plugins suitable for {\ttfamily spec} they need to be able to store all the metadata as specified in \href{/home/jenkins/workspace/libelektra-release/doc/METADATA.ini}{\tt M\+E\+T\+A\+D\+A\+T\+A.\+ini}. Most file formats do not have support for that.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item store metadata in the comments like the {\ttfamily ini} plugin\+: this exposes internal metadata into the comments and can drastically affect the readability of a storage file. Comments should never be touched by a parser.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Use different storage plugins, or plugins with different configurations, for the {\ttfamily spec} namespace\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily ni}
\item T\+O\+ML with {\ttfamily meta} configuration
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We do not need a storage plugin suitable for everything.
\item The problems that internal metadata ends up in configuration files disappears.
\end{DoxyItemize}

We need to have different default plugins in {\ttfamily spec} than in the other namespaces.
