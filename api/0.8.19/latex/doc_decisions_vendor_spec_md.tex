\subsection*{Issue}

Vendors (distributors, administrators) might want to modify the specification. gsettings has a similar feature.

\subsection*{Constraints}

There are many constraints in providing such a feature because it is possible to get an inconsistent or unusable specification.

\subsection*{Assumptions}

Developers who elektrify their applications do care about good integration and being administer friendly.

\subsection*{Considered Alternatives}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item implementing a new namespace that gets merged
\item merge specification files during installation
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Decision}

Provide means that a single specification can satisfy every distribution and administrator.

\subsection*{Argument}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Elektra wants to reduce fragmentation, and vendor specific changes obviously is a severe kind of fragmentation
\item providing vendor overrides/fallbacks might be an excuse to not provide better typing or general overrides/fallbacks features which would avoid the need for a vendor overrides/fallbacks at all
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Implications}

Provide means for a single specification to be very good integrated in every system.
