Does a three-\/way merge between keysets. On success the resulting keyset will be saved to mergepath. On unresolved conflicts nothing will be changed.

The {\ttfamily kdb merge} command uses a three-\/way merge by default. A three-\/way merge is when three versions of a file (or in this case, Key\+Set) are compared in order to automatically merge the changes made to the Key\+Set over time. These three versions of the Key\+Set are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily base}\+: The {\ttfamily base} Key\+Set is the original version of the Key\+Set.
\item {\ttfamily ours}\+: The {\ttfamily ours} Key\+Set represents the user's current version of the Key\+Set. This Key\+Set differs from {\ttfamily base} for every key you changed.
\item {\ttfamily theirs}\+: The {\ttfamily theirs} Key\+Set usually represents the default version of a Key\+Set (usually the package maintainer's version). This Key\+Set differs from {\ttfamily base} for every key someone has changed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The three-\/way merge works by comparing the {\ttfamily ours} Key\+Set and the {\ttfamily theirs} Key\+Set to the {\ttfamily base} Key\+Set. By looking for differences in these Key\+Sets, a new Key\+Set called {\ttfamily result} is created that represents a merge of these Key\+Sets.

Conflicts occur when a Key has a different value in all three Key\+Sets. Conflicts in a merge can be resolved using a \href{#STRATEGIES}{\tt strategy} with the {\ttfamily -\/s} option. To interactively resolve conflicts, use the {\ttfamily -\/i} option.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/\+H}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/help}\+: Show the man page.
\item {\ttfamily -\/\+V}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/version}\+: Print version info.
\item {\ttfamily -\/p}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/profile}=$<$profile$>$\+: Use a different kdb profile.
\item {\ttfamily s}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/strategy $<$name$>$}\+: Specify which strategy should be used to resolve conflicts.
\item {\ttfamily -\/v}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/verbose}\+: Explain what is happening.
\item {\ttfamily -\/i}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/interactive} Interactively resolve the conflicts.

To complete a simple merge of three Key\+Sets\+: {\ttfamily kdb merge user/ours user/theirs user/base user/result}

To complete a merge whilst using the {\ttfamily ours} version of the Key\+Set to resolve conflicts\+: {\ttfamily kdb merge -\/s ours user/ours user/theirs user/base user/result}

To complete a three-\/way merge and overwrite all current keys in the {\ttfamily resultpath}\+: {\ttfamily kdb merge -\/s cut user/ours user/theirs user/base user/result}
