This plugin allows applications to access command-\/line options and environment variables via the KDB.

It is implemented as a simple frontend for the parser implemented in the internal {\ttfamily elektra\+Get\+Opts}.

For more information on how to write the necessary specification and on using command-\/line options in general, take a look at \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_tutorials_command-line-options_md}{the dedicated tutorial}}

Depending on the calling context and configuration, this plugin might use operating system specific functions to determine command-\/line arguments and environment variables. Which operating system\textquotesingle{}s functions the plugin uses is determined at compile-\/time.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} One of the system-\/specific implementations of this plugin relies on procfs. Therefore, if you compile the plugin on a system with procfs, the plugin may not work on other machine with the same OS or even on the same machine, if procfs is not mounted. \end{quote}

See \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_INSTALL_md}{installation}}. The package is called {\ttfamily libelektra5-\/experimental}.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_gopts_README_autotoc_md220}{}\doxysection{Basic Usage}\label{md_src_plugins_gopts_README_autotoc_md220}
The preferred way of using this plugin is via a {\ttfamily kdb\+Open} contract\+:

\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_gopts_README_autotoc_md221}{}\doxysection{Configuration Keys}\label{md_src_plugins_gopts_README_autotoc_md221}
The plugin accepts a number of configuration keys.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily /offset}\+: You can set this key to an integer {\ttfamily n}. The plugin will then ignore the first {\ttfamily n} command-\/line arguments and only pass the rest on to the parser.
\item {\ttfamily /help/usage}\+: The value of this key is used to replace the standard usage line in the auto-\/generated help message.
\item {\ttfamily /help/prefix}\+: The value of this key is inserted between the usage line and the options list in the auto-\/generated help message.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_gopts_README_autotoc_md222}{}\doxysection{Global Key\+Set}\label{md_src_plugins_gopts_README_autotoc_md222}
The plugin also takes part of its configuration from the global Key\+Set. All keys the plugin uses are below {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/gopts}. This prefix is abbreviated to {\ttfamily //} below.

This plugin may use the following keys from the global Key\+Set\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily //parent}\+: If present, the plugin will use this key instead of the one provided by {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} as the parent key pass on to the parser. Specifically, the plugin uses this keys value as the key name for a new key that is passed to the parser.
\item {\ttfamily //argc}\+: If present and {\ttfamily //parent} is present as well, the plugin expects {\ttfamily //argv} to be present as well. This key must be binary and its value must be an {\ttfamily int}.
\item {\ttfamily //argv}\+: If present and {\ttfamily //parent} is present as well, the plugin expects {\ttfamily //argc} to be present as well. The values of {\ttfamily //argc} and {\ttfamily //argv} will be used instead of using the OS specific implementation. This key must be binary and its value must be a {\ttfamily const char $\ast$ const $\ast$}.
\item {\ttfamily //envp}\+: If present and {\ttfamily //parent} is present as well, the value of this key will be used as the list of environment variables. This key must be binary and its value must be a {\ttfamily const char $\ast$ const $\ast$}.
\item {\ttfamily //args}\+: If present and {\ttfamily //parent} is present as well, but {\ttfamily //argc} and {\ttfamily //argv} are absent, this will be used as the list of command-\/line arguments. This key must be binary and its value must be a zero-\/byte separated (and terminated) list of strings.
\item {\ttfamily //env}\+: If present and {\ttfamily //parent} is present as well, but {\ttfamily //envp} is absent, this will be used as the list of environment variable. This key must be binary and its value must be a zero-\/byte separated (and terminated) list of strings.
