We are proud to release Elektra 0.\+8.$<$$<$\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+O\+N$>$$>$.

\subsection*{Possible Introduction Text}

We are proud to present our largest release so far. It is the first release of the 0.\+9.$\ast$ version series, which goal is it\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item to prepare Elektra for 1.\+0.\+0
\item to remove compatibility layers
\item to prototypes that did not reach maturity
\end{DoxyItemize}

The 0.\+8.$\ast$ version series will still be maintained but with a low priority -- the highest priority will be to get Elektra 1.\+0.\+0 done. If you have maintenance requests and want 0.\+8.\+26 to be released, please contact us via \href{mailto:business@libelektra.org}{\tt business@libelektra.\+org}

\subsection*{Business Plans}

To get away from a purely research-\/oriented approach to a mature foundation, we also need paid employees to fix problems.

We plan to introduce following ways of income\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item donations
\item paid support/feature requests
\item consultancy
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

If you are interested in any of these, please contact us via \href{mailto:business@libelektra.org}{\tt business@libelektra.\+org}

Please note, that Elektra will definitely stay 100\% free software (B\+SD licensed).

\subsection*{What is Elektra?}

\subsubsection*{Type (New Version)}

The {\ttfamily type} plugin was completely rewritten in C. The old version is now called {\ttfamily cpptype}. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+

The new {\ttfamily type} plugin also provides the functionality of the {\ttfamily enum} and the {\ttfamily boolean} plugin. These plugins are now considered obsolete and you should use {\ttfamily type} instead.

A few notes on compatibility\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the new {\ttfamily type} does not support the full feature set of {\ttfamily enum} and {\ttfamily boolean}, but it supports the features we consider useful.
\item the new {\ttfamily type} doesn\textquotesingle{}t support {\ttfamily F\+S\+Type} and {\ttfamily empty}. These have been deprecated for a long time and there are good alternatives available.
\item the new {\ttfamily type} supports {\ttfamily enum}, {\ttfamily wchar} and {\ttfamily wstring} as types, whereas the old {\ttfamily cpptype} would throw an error for these. In most cases this won\textquotesingle{}t be a problem, but you should be aware of this breaking change.
\item the new {\ttfamily type} does not support {\ttfamily check/type/min} and {\ttfamily check/type/max}, please use the {\ttfamily range} plugin.
\end{DoxyItemize}

To switch from {\ttfamily enum} to the new {\ttfamily type}, you have to add either {\ttfamily check/type=enum} or {\ttfamily type=enum}. Without a {\ttfamily check/type} or {\ttfamily type} metakey, the {\ttfamily type} plugin will ignore the key. We now also support converting enum values to and from integer values (see \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/type}{\tt R\+E\+A\+D\+ME}).

To switch from {\ttfamily boolean} to the new {\ttfamily type}, you don\textquotesingle{}t have to do anything, if you used the default config. If you used a custom configuration please take a look at the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/type}{\tt R\+E\+A\+D\+ME}.

\subsubsection*{kdb\+Ensure}

{\ttfamily kdb\+Ensure} is a new function in {\ttfamily elektra-\/kdb}. It can be used to ensure that a K\+DB instance meets certain clauses specified in a contract. In principle this a very powerful tool that may be used for a lot of things. For now it only supports a few clauses concerning plugins\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can specify that a plugin should be mounted globally. This can for example be used to enable the new \href{#gopts}{\tt gopts} plugin.
\item Conversely you can also define that a plugin should not be mounted globally, e.\+g. to disable the {\ttfamily spec} plugin, which is enabled by default.
\item Additionally you may want to enforce that a global plugin uses a certain configuration. For this case you can specify that the plugin should be remounted, i.\+e. unmounted and immediately mounted again.
\item Because of the different architecture involved, for now only unmounting of non-\/global plugins is supported.
\end{DoxyItemize}

All changes made by {\ttfamily kdb\+Ensure} are purely temporary. They will only apply to the K\+DB handle passed to the function.

I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+NT\+: {\ttfamily kdb\+Ensure} only works, if the {\ttfamily list} plugin is mounted in all appropriate global positions.

Note\+: {\ttfamily kdb\+Ensure} right now ignores the {\ttfamily infos/recommends} and {\ttfamily infos/needs} metadata of plugins, so you have to explicitly take care of dependencies. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+

\subsubsection*{Error Code Concept}

With this release, we changed our messy error code system into a more structured and clean way. Similar to \href{https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.sqls.doc/ids_sqs_0809.htm}{\tt S\+Q\+L\+States} we changed to structure of our error codes and migrated them. Have a look into the new codes. This allows us to easily extend the specification without breaking existing codes and to avoid risking duplicated errors as we had before. \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+

\subsection*{Plugins}

The following section lists news about the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme}{\tt modules} we updated in this release.

\subsubsection*{Base64}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We fixed some warnings about implicit type conversions reported by \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html}{\tt U\+B\+San}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Cache}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/cache}{\tt cache} is a new global caching plugin. It uses \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/mmapstorage}{\tt mmapstorage} as its storage backend and lazily stores keysets from previous ´kdb\+Get()´ calls. We added initial support for the default resolver and multifile resolver. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Add check of resolved filenames, fixes false cache hits. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Execute only {\ttfamily P\+R\+O\+C\+G\+E\+T\+S\+T\+O\+R\+A\+GE} global plugins when we have a cache hit. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Fix two data loss bugs when using {\ttfamily cache} with {\ttfamily multifile} resolver. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Fix G\+CC A\+S\+AN build warnings \#2820. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Add tools for enabling, disabling and clearing the cache ({\ttfamily kdb cache \{enable,disable,default,clear\}}). \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Enable cache when {\ttfamily ini} is used. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{crypto / fcrypt}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Empty G\+PG key I\+Ds in the plugin configuration are being ignored by the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/crypto}{\tt crypto} plugin and the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/fcrypt}{\tt fcrypt} plugin. Adding empty G\+PG key I\+Ds would lead to an error when {\ttfamily gpg} is being invoked.\+\_\+(\+Peter Nirschl)\+\_\+
\item Apply Base64 encoding to the master password, which is stored within the plugin configuration. This fixes a problem that occurs if ini is used as default storage (see \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/2591}{\tt 2591}).\+\_\+(\+Peter Nirschl)\+\_\+
\item Fix compilation without deprecated Open\+S\+SL A\+P\+Is. Initialization and deinitialization is not needed anymore. \+\_\+(\+Rosen Penev)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{C\+S\+V\+Storage}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Support D\+OS newlines for the csvstorage plugin. \+\_\+(Vlad -\/ Ioan Balan)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{filecheck}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We fixed some warnings about implicit type conversions reported by \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html}{\tt U\+B\+San}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{g\+Opts}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/gopts}{\tt gopts} plugin simply retrieves the values of {\ttfamily argc}, {\ttfamily argv} and {\ttfamily envp} needed for \href{https://www.libelektra.org/tutorials/command-line-options}{\tt {\ttfamily elektra\+Get\+Opts}} and then makes the call. It is intended to be used as a global plugin, so that command-\/line options are automatically parsed when {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} is called. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The plugin works under W\+I\+N32 (via {\ttfamily Get\+Command\+LineW} and {\ttfamily Get\+Environment\+String}), M\+A\+C\+\_\+\+O\+SX ({\ttfamily \+\_\+\+N\+S\+Get\+Argc}, {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+N\+S\+Get\+Argv}) and any system that either has a {\ttfamily sysctl(3)} function that accepts {\ttfamily K\+E\+R\+N\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+C\+\_\+\+A\+R\+GS} (e.\+g. Free\+B\+SD) or when {\ttfamily procfs} is mounted and either {\ttfamily /proc/self} or {\ttfamily /proc/curproc} refers to the current process. If you need support for any other systems, feel free to add an implementation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{I\+NI}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily ini} when only the root key needs to be written. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Plugin writes to ini files without spaces around \textquotesingle{}=\textquotesingle{} anymore. Reading is still possible with and without spaces. \+\_\+(\+Oleksandr Shabelnyk)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{macaddr}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a plugin to handle M\+AC addresses. {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} converts a M\+AC address into a decimal 64-\/bit integer (with the most significant 16 bits always set to 0), if the format is supported. {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} restores the converted values back to there original form. \+\_\+(\+Thomas Bretterbauer)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{m\+I\+NI}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We fixed compiler warnings reported by G\+CC 9 in the \href{/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/src/plugins/mini/testmod_mini.c}{\tt unit test code} of the plugin. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{mmapstorage}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/mmapstorage}{\tt mmapstorage} is now able to persist the Global Key\+Set, which is used by the {\ttfamily cache} plugin. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Fixed support for {\ttfamily kdb import} and {\ttfamily kdb export}. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{multifile}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed segmentation fault in {\ttfamily kdb\+Error()} function. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Added Global Keyset handle to storage plugin. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Fixed use of wrong resolver handle in the {\ttfamily kdb\+Error()} function. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Quickdump}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/quickdump}{\tt quickdump} is a new storage plugin. It implements a more concise form of the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/dump}{\tt dump} format, which is also quicker too read. Contrary to dump, quickdump only stores keynames relative to the parent key. This allows easy relocation of configurations. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item quickdump now also uses an variable length integer encoding to further reduce file size. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Reference}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed missing Metadata in R\+E\+A\+D\+ME and M\+E\+T\+A\+D\+A\+T\+A.\+ini. \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\item Update R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md web tool to show, how to test R\+E\+ST A\+PI on localhost. \+\_\+(\+Dmytro Moiseiuk)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{R\+G\+B\+Color}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item New plugin to validate hex formatted colors (e.\+g. \#fff or \#abcd) and normalize them to rgba (4294967295 (= 0xffffffff) and 2864434397 (= 0xaabbccdd) respectively). It also has support for named colors according to the \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#svg-color}{\tt extended color keywords} from C\+S\+S3. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{semlock}

removed due to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item constant pain
\item never worked properly
\item poor design
\item no time in future to maintain \+\_\+(\+Kurt Micheli)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{spec}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The spec plugin was partly rewritten to better support specifications for arrays. This includes some breaking changes concerning the less used (and also less functional) parts of the plugin. To find out more about these changes take a look at the \hyperlink{md_src_plugins_spec_README_src_plugins_spec_README_md}{R\+E\+A\+D\+ME}. It now better reflects the actually implemented behaviour. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Specload}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/specload}{\tt specload} plugin is a special storage plugin. Instead of using a storage file it calls an external application to request its specification. For the transfer it relies on the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/quickdump}{\tt quickdump} plugin. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item Currently changing the specification is only allowed in a very limited way. However, in future the plugin should allow overriding a specification in all cases where this can be done safely. N\+O\+TE\+: While the plugin technically allows some modifications, because of a problem with the resolver this cannot be used right now (see \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/specload}{\tt limitations}).
\item We also export {\ttfamily elektra\+Specload\+Send\+Spec} to abstract over the {\ttfamily quickdump} dependency. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Syslog}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We fixed an incorrect format specifier in a call to the {\ttfamily syslog} function. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{unit}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item New plugin to validate units of memory and normalize them into bytes. E.\+g. 20 KB (normalized to 20000 Byte). \+\_\+(\+Marcel Hauri)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Y\+A\+JL}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugin now allows setting a value to the mountpoint. This is represented as a top level value in J\+S\+ON if no other key is present. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item The plugin no longer lists empty parent keys with {\ttfamily kdb ls}. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item The plugin signifies arrays with the metakey array according to the \hyperlink{doc_decisions_array_md}{array decision}. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item The plugin no longer produces additional {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+dirdata} entries for empty array keys. See also issue \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/2477}{\tt \#2477}. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Y\+A\+M\+Bi}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yambi}{\tt Y\+A\+M\+Bi} is now able detect multiple syntax errors in a file. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The error message now includes more information about the location of syntax errors. For example, for the incorrect Y\+A\+ML input {\ttfamily config.\+yaml}\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
key 1: - element 1
 - element 2
key 2: scalar
       - element 3
\end{DoxyCode}


, the plugin prints an error message that includes the following text\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
config.yaml:2:2: syntax error, unexpected start of sequence, expecting end of map or key
                  - element 2
                  ^
config.yaml:4:8: syntax error, unexpected start of sequence, expecting end of map or key
                        - element 3
                        ^
\end{DoxyCode}


. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yambi}{\tt Y\+A\+M\+Bi} now supports Elektra’s \hyperlink{doc_decisions_bool_md}{boolean data type}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The plugin now handles Y\+A\+ML key-\/value pairs without a value at the end of a file correctly. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The plugin now converts Y\+A\+ML key-\/value pairs with empty value to null/empty keys. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yambi}{\tt Y\+A\+M\+Bi} now converts empty files to a key set containing an empty version of the parent key. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Y\+A\+ML C\+PP}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugin now handles keys that are part of a map, but use a basename ending with \hyperlink{doc_tutorials_arrays_md}{array syntax} correctly. For example, in a key set that contains keys with the following names\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
user/array/#0
user/array/#1
user/map/#0
user/map/key
user/map/#1
\end{DoxyCode}


, {\ttfamily user/array/\#0} and {\ttfamily user/array/\#1} represent array elements, while {\ttfamily user/map/\#0}, and {\ttfamily user/map/\#1} do not, since the key set also contains the key {\ttfamily user/map/key}. The following \href{https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/shell_recorder/tutorial_wrapper}{\tt Markdown Shell Recorder} snippet shows the new behavior of the plugin\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
kdb mount config.yaml user yamlcpp
kdb set user/array/#0 one
kdb set user/array/#1 two
kdb set user/map/#0   three
kdb set user/map/key  four
kdb set user/map/#1   five
kdb file user | xargs cat
#> array:
#>   - one
#>   - two
#> map:
#>   "#0": three
#>   "#1": five
#>   key: four
\end{DoxyCode}


. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ../../src/plugins/yamlcpp/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}\+Y\+A\+M\+L C\+P\+P\char`\"{} now handles the conversion from and to \hyperlink{doc_decisions_bool_md}{Elektra’s boolean type} properly. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The plugin converts “sparse” key sets properly. For example, for the key set that contains {\bfseries only} the key\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily user/parent/\#1/\#2/map/\#0} with the value {\ttfamily arr}
\end{DoxyItemize}

and uses {\ttfamily user/parent} as parent key, Y\+A\+ML C\+PP stores the following Y\+A\+ML data\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
- ~
- - ~
  - ~
  - map:
      - arr
\end{DoxyCode}


. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ../../src/plugins/yamlcpp/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}\+Y\+A\+M\+L C\+P\+P\char`\"{} now supports mixed data (nested lists \& sequences) better. For example, the plugin now correctly converts the Y\+A\+ML data
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
root:
  - element: one
  - element: two
\end{DoxyCode}


to the key set that contains the following keys\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
user/tests/yaml/root
user/tests/yaml/root/#0/element
user/tests/yaml/root/#1/element
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Y\+A\+ML Smith}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yamlsmith}{\tt Y\+A\+ML Smith} now converts keys that shares a common prefix correctly. For example, the last command in the script\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
kdb mount config.yaml user/tests/yaml yaml
kdb set user/tests/yaml/common/one/#0 value
kdb set user/tests/yaml/common/two/#0 first
kdb set user/tests/yaml/common/two/#1 second
kdb export user/tests/yaml yamlsmith
\end{DoxyCode}


now prints the following Y\+A\+ML data\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
common:
  one:
    - "value"
  two:
    - "first"
    - "second"
\end{DoxyCode}


. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugin now converts Elektra’s boolean values ({\ttfamily 0}, {\ttfamily 1}) back to Y\+A\+M\+L’s boolean values ({\ttfamily true}, {\ttfamily false}). \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Yan LR}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The build system now disables the plugin, if you installed a version of A\+N\+T\+LR 4 that does not support A\+N\+T\+L\+R’s C++ runtime (like A\+N\+T\+LR {\ttfamily 4.\+5.\+x} or earlier). \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item We fixed an ambiguity in the \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/yanlr/YAML.g4}{\tt Y\+A\+ML grammar}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The build system now regenerates the modified parsing code, every time we update the grammar file. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The plugin now reports the location of syntax errors correctly. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The lexer for the plugin now emits start tokens for maps at the correct location inside the token stream. This update fixes a problem, where the plugin sometimes reported incorrect error messages for the {\itshape first} syntax error in a Y\+A\+ML file. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The plugin now stores the end position of map start tokens correctly. Before this update the plugin would sometimes not show the markers ({\ttfamily $^\wedge$}) that point to the error positions inside the input. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yanlr}{\tt Yan LR} now supports Elektra’s \hyperlink{doc_decisions_bool_md}{boolean data type}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The plugin now handles Y\+A\+ML key-\/value pairs that contain no value at the end of a file correctly. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The plugin now converts Y\+A\+ML key-\/value pairs with empty value to null/empty keys. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The plugin converts “empty” Y\+A\+ML files to a key set that contains an empty version of the parent key. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Y\+Awn}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yawn}{\tt Y\+Awn} is now able to print error messages for multiple syntax errors. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item We also improved the error messages of Y\+Awn, which now also contain the input that caused a syntax error. For example, for the input
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
key: value
  - element
\end{DoxyCode}


the plugin prints an error message that contains the following text\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
config.yaml:2:3: Syntax error on input “start of sequence”
                   - element
                   ^
\end{DoxyCode}


. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugin now supports Elektra’s \hyperlink{doc_decisions_bool_md}{boolean data type}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Libraries}

The text below summarizes updates to the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme}{\tt C (and C++)-\/based libraries} of Elektra.

\subsubsection*{Compatibility}

As always, the A\+BI and A\+PI of kdb.\+h is fully compatible, i.\+e. programs compiled against an older 0.\+8 version of Elektra will continue to work (A\+BI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (A\+PI).

\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$
\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Core}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} now calls global postgetstorage plugins with the parent key passed to {\ttfamily kdb\+Get}, instead of a random mountpoint. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item Fixed a double cleanup error (segmentation fault) when mounting global plugins. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Logging in Elektra was changed with this release. If Elektra is compiled with {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+L\+O\+G\+G\+ER} enabled, we now log warnings and errors to stderr and everything except debug messages to syslog. If {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} is also enabled, debug messages are logged to syslog as well. Previously you had to make some manual changes to the code, to see most of the logging messages. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The logger does not truncate the file name incorrectly anymore, if {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+E\+\_\+\+\_\+} contains a relative (instead of an absolute) filepath. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item Disabled any plugin execution when we have a cache hit or no update from backends. The old behaviour can be enabled for testing using {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} and adding the {\ttfamily \char`\"{}debug\+Global\+Positions\char`\"{}} meta key to the parent\+Key of the kdb\+Get invocation. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item Removed {\ttfamily ingroup} from error messages to reduce verbosity. \+\_\+(\+Michael Zronek)\+\_\+
\item Fixed minor problem when {\ttfamily kdb\+\_\+long\+\_\+double\+\_\+t} is not available (e.\+g. mips32). \+\_\+(\+Matthias Schoepfer)\+\_\+
\item Only add benchmarks if {\ttfamily B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+T\+E\+ST} is set in cmake. \+\_\+(\+Matthias Schoepfer)\+\_\+
\item We fixed some warnings about implicit conversion to {\ttfamily unsigned int} reported by \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html}{\tt U\+B\+San}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Ease}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The functions for reference resolving used in the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/reference}{\tt reference plugin} have been extracted into libease. This lets other parts of Elektra easily use references and ensures a consistent syntax for them. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+

\subsection*{Bindings}

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using \href{https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme}{\tt various programming languages}. This section keeps you up to date with the multi-\/language support provided by Elektra.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item J\+NA is now not experimental anymore. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item gsettings is not default anymore. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Add fix for creating the Key and Key\+Set objects in the Hello\+Elektra.\+java file. \+\_\+(\+Dmytro Moiseiuk)\+\_\+
\item We fixed a \href{https://issues.libelektra.org/2670}{\tt warning about a deprecated default constructor} in the C++ binding reported by G\+CC 9.\+0. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$

\subsection*{Tools}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily kdb get -\/v} now displays if the resulting value is a default-\/value defined by the metadata of the key. \+\_\+(\+Thomas Bretterbauer)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb cp} now succeeds if the target-\/keys already have the same values as the source-\/keys. \+\_\+(\+Thomas Bretterbauer)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily web-\/ui} issue \#2441 is fixed in form of a workaround \+\_\+(\+Josef Wechselauer)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb import} does not fail anymore if executed more than once with the same target in the spec-\/namespace. \+\_\+(\+Thomas Bretterbauer)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb mount} avoid adding sync if sync is already provided. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb list-\/tools} now supports {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+E\+X\+E\+C\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH} environment variables that contain spaces. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily gen-\/gpg-\/testkey} is added to the default tools list (see \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/2668}{\tt \#2668}).\+\_\+(\+Peter Nirschl)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb getenv} now executed correctly from within tests \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb-\/bash-\/completion} was fixed (see \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/pull/2836}{\tt \#2836}). \+\_\+(\+Eduardo Santana)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily kdb rm} supports {\ttfamily -\/-\/without-\/elektra} and returns 11 on key not found. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$
\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Code generation}

{\ttfamily kdb gen} is now no longer an external tool implemented via python, but rather a first class command of the {\ttfamily kdb} tool. For now it only supports code generation for use with the highlevel A\+PI. Try it by running {\ttfamily kdb gen elektra $<$parent\+Key$>$ $<$output\+Name$>$}, where {\ttfamily $<$parent\+Key$>$} is the parent key of the specification to use and {\ttfamily $<$output\+Name$>$} is some prefix for the output files. If you don\textquotesingle{}t have your specification mounted, use {\ttfamily kdb gen -\/F $<$plugin$>$\+:$<$file$>$ elektra $<$parent\+Key$>$ $<$output\+Name$>$} to load it from {\ttfamily $<$file$>$} using plugin {\ttfamily $<$plugin$>$}.

.. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+

\subsection*{Scripts}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily reformat-\/source} script now also formats {\ttfamily tests/shell/include\+\_\+common.\+sh.\+in}. Additionally it ensures that the file is 1000 lines long, so that line numbers of files using it are easier to read. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The clang-\/format wrapper script now also checks the supported maximum version of Clang-\/\+Format. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The script \href{https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/reformat-shfmt}{\tt {\ttfamily reformat-\/shfmt}} now also reformats shell support files ({\ttfamily $\ast$.in}) in the \href{https://master.libelektra.org/scripts}{\tt {\ttfamily scripts}} folder. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item The {\ttfamily reformat-\/$\ast$} scripts now allow you to specify a list of files that should be formatted. Only files actual suitable for the reformat script, will reformat. So e.\+g. calling {\ttfamily reformat-\/cmake \hyperlink{kdbprivate_8h}{src/include/kdbprivate.\+h}} doesn\textquotesingle{}t change any files. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The script {\ttfamily scripts/reformat-\/all} is a new convenience script that calls all other {\ttfamily reformat-\/$\ast$} scripts. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The script {\ttfamily scripts/pre-\/commit-\/check-\/formatting} can be used as a pre-\/commit hook, to ensure files are formatted before committing. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The link checker now prints broken links to the standard error output. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item We added a script, called `benchmark-\/yaml` that compares the run-\/time of the Y\+A\+ML plugins\+:
\item Added {\ttfamily kdb reset} and {\ttfamily kdb reset-\/elektra}, fixed {\ttfamily kdb stash}. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+

\end{DoxyItemize}

for a certain input file with \href{https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine}{\tt hyperfine}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Benchmarks}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The benchmarking tool \href{/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/benchmarks/plugingetset.c}{\tt {\ttfamily benchmark\+\_\+plugingetset}} now also supports only executing the {\ttfamily get} method for the specified plugin. For example, to convert the data stored in the file {\ttfamily benchmarks/data/yaypeg.\+test.\+in} with the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yaypeg}{\tt Y\+Ay P\+EG plugin} to a key set you can now use the following command\+:

instead of


\begin{DoxyCode}
filename|line col 0|
\end{DoxyCode}


to show the location data for broken links. This is also the same style that Clang and G\+CC use when they display location information for compiler errors. This update has the advantage, that certain tools such as \href{https://macromates.com}{\tt Text\+Mate} are able to convert the location data, providing additional features, such as clickable links to the error source. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+

\subsection*{Infrastructure}

\subsubsection*{Cirrus}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We added the build job {\ttfamily 🔗 Check}, which checks the documentation for broken links. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$
\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Jenkins}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We disabled the tests\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+crypto\+\_\+botan},
\item {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+crypto\+\_\+openssl},
\item {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+dbus},
\item {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+dbusrecv},
\item {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+fcrypt},
\item {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+gpgme}, and
\item {\ttfamily testmod\+\_\+zeromqsend}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Restyled}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We added a configuration file for \href{https://restyled.io}{\tt Restyled}. Currently \href{https://restyled.io}{\tt Restyled} monitors changes to Shell code in pull requests and fixes code that does not fit the \hyperlink{doc_CODING_md}{coding guideline}, by adding additional formatting commit to P\+Rs. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Travis}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We removed the build job for the Haskell binding and \hyperlink{md_src_plugins_haskell_README_src_plugins_haskell_README_md}{Haskell plugin}. For more information, please take a look \href{https://issues.libelektra.org/2751}{\tt here}. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item We always use G\+CC 9 for the build job {\ttfamily 🍏 G\+CC}. This update makes sure that the build job succeeds, even if Homebrew adds a new major version of the compiler. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\item We simplified our Travis configuration file, removing various unnecessary and unused code. In this process we also got rid of the caching directives, we previously used to speed up the Haskell build job {\ttfamily 🍏 Haskell}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}
