This plugin checks whether the value of a key is a valid file system path.

\subsection*{Purpose}

The motivation to write this plugin is given by the two paths that exist in /etc/fstab\+: the device file and the mountpoint. A missing file is not necessarily an error, because the device file may appear later when a device is plugged in and the mountpoint may be there when another subsequent mount was executed. So only warnings are yielded in that case. One situation, however, presents an error\+: Only an absolute path is allowed to occur for both device and mountpoint. When checking for relative files, it is not enough to look at the first character if it is a {\ttfamily /}, because remote file systems and some special names are valid, too.

\subsection*{Usage}

If the metakey {\ttfamily check/path} is present, it is checked if the value is a valid absolute file system path. If a metavalue is present, an additional check will be done if it is a directory or device file.
