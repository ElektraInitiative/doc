Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database. For more information, visit \href{https://libelektra.org}{\texttt{ https\+://libelektra.\+org}}.\hypertarget{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3003}{}\doxysection{Highlights}\label{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3003}
This is by far the largest release in Elektra\textquotesingle{}s history. In 2813 commits, 19 authors changed 1714 files with 92462 insertions(+) and 21532 deletions(-\/). The highlights are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item libelektra.\+org\+: new website and puppet-\/libelektra
\item plugin+bindings for Haskell and Ruby
\item improved shell completion
\item new plugins\+: yamlcpp, camel, mini, date, file, range, multifile, xerces, ipaddr
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3004}{}\doxysubsection{libelektra.\+org}\label{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3004}
Unfortunately this release was delayed. The reason for the delay is that our community server (\href{https://build.libelektra.org}{\texttt{ build server}}, web site,...) was compromised and we needed to reinstall everything from scratch.

We took advantage of the situation, and reinstalled everything properly managed by \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/puppet-libelektra}{\texttt{ puppet-\/libelektra}}. With puppet-\/libelektra, you can directly set keys, specifications (validations), and even mount new configuration files from within Puppet.

Our community server is now completely managed by libelektra.

Thanks to Bernhard Denner, for rescuing us from the difficult situation, especially for the sprint shortly before the release.

As already already announced in \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/news/2016-12-17_website_release.md}{\texttt{ December 2016}} we completely reimplemented our website. Now all our websites are available via https. This release is the first one that includes the source code of the website and its snippet sharing functionality.

The backend for this snippet sharing website uses Elektra itself\+: both for its configuration and for the configuration snippets.

Thanks again to Marvin Mall for the awesome website.\hypertarget{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3005}{}\doxysubsubsection{Haskell and Ruby}\label{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3005}
The Ruby binding, created by Bernhard Denner, was greatly improved and now includes libtools bindings. It is the first binding that goes beyond Elektra\textquotesingle{}s main API. Bernhard Denner also added many \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/bindings/swig/ruby/examples}{\texttt{ examples}} that demonstrate how you can take advantage of the Ruby bindings.

Armin Wurzinger created a new binding for the functional language Haskell. He also added support for Haskell plugins. Due to generic CMake and C Code, plugins can be written exclusively in Haskell, without any glue code. Several Haskell examples already exist. The Haskell support is currently experimental.\hypertarget{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3006}{}\doxysubsection{Shell Completion}\label{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3006}
René Schwaiger added completion support for \href{http://fishshell.com}{\texttt{ Fish}} in this release. We also extended our support for other shells\+: The new tool {\ttfamily kdb complete} suggests how to complete an Elektra path. It considers mountpoints and also takes bookmarks into account. Thanks to Armin Wurzinger for creating this useful utility. Our Zsh and fish completions already take advantage of {\ttfamily kdb complete}. Thanks to Sebastian Bachmann for taking the time to update the {\ttfamily zsh} completions.\hypertarget{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3007}{}\doxysubsection{New Plugins}\label{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3007}
See \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/}{\texttt{ plugin overview}} to get an overview of the ever-\/growing number of plugins.

The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yamlcpp}{\texttt{ yamlcpp plugin}} and camel plugin add first support for YAML.

The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/mini}{\texttt{ mini plugin}} is yet another minimal INI plugin.

Thanks to René Schwaiger.

The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/date}{\texttt{ date plugin}} supports validation of dates according to three standards\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily RFC2822}
\item {\ttfamily ISO8601}
\item {\ttfamily POSIX}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/multifile}{\texttt{ multifile plugin}} allows us to integrate many configuration files via globbing with a single mount command. It supports {\ttfamily .d} configuration directories as often used today.

The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/file}{\texttt{ file plugin}} interprets the content of a file as configuration value.

The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/ipaddr}{\texttt{ ipaddr plugin}} adds support for IP address validation on systems that do not support {\ttfamily getaddrinfo}.

Thanks to Thomas Waser for creating these useful plugins.

The \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xerces}{\texttt{ xerces plugin}} supplants the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xmltool}{\texttt{ xmltool plugin}} and allows us to use XML files not following a specific schemata. Attributes are mapped to Elektra\textquotesingle{}s metadata, multiple keys with the same names are mapped to arrays.

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.\hypertarget{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3008}{}\doxysection{Documentation}\label{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3008}

We added even more functionality, which could not make it to the highlights\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item DBUS support for qt-\/gui (listening to configuration changes)\+: qt-\/gui gets a viewer-\/mode where configuration settings are immediately updated via DBus notifications, thanks to Raffael Pancheri With the new qt-\/gui and newer qt releases ($\sim$5.7) the qtquick experience is much smoother, for example, the tree view does not collapse on syncs anymore.
\item Armin Wurzinger greatly improved the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/jna}{\texttt{ JNA binding}}. The build system now uses Maven to build them. Armin also added Doxygen documentation and a \href{http://master.libelektra.org/scripts/randoop/randoop.in}{\texttt{ script}} to test the JNA binding using \href{https://randoop.github.io/randoop}{\texttt{ Randoop}}.
\item The improved \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/curlget}{\texttt{ curlget plugin}}, is now able to upload configuration files, thanks to Thomas Waser and Peter Nirschl (CMake fixes).
\item New command {\ttfamily kdb rmmeta}, thanks to Bernhard Denner
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/crypto}{\texttt{ crypto plugin}} and \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/fcrypt}{\texttt{ fcrypt plugin}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugin now list available GPG keys when config is missing
\item You can now specify signatures via the configuration option {\ttfamily sign/key}
\item New text mode, enabled by default (disable by setting {\ttfamily fcrypt/textmode} to {\ttfamily 0})
\item New option {\ttfamily fcrypt/tmpdir} allows you to specify the output directory of {\ttfamily gpg}
\item If you want to learn how to use the plugin please check out our new \href{https://asciinema.org/a/153014}{\texttt{ ASCII cast}}
\item thanks to Peter Nirschl
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Thomas Waser added useful scripts\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-mount-list-all-files.md}{\texttt{ mount-\/list-\/all-\/files}} to list all mounted files.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-mountpoint-info.md}{\texttt{ mountpoint-\/info}} to provide more info about mountpoints.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-stash.md}{\texttt{ stash}} to stash away Elektra\textquotesingle{}s configuration, to be restored using {\ttfamily restore}.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-backup.md}{\texttt{ backup}} to backup Elektra\textquotesingle{}s configuration.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-restore.md}{\texttt{ restore}} to restore a backup or stash.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-check-env-dep.md}{\texttt{ check-\/env-\/dep}} allows users to check if environment has influence on configuration settings.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-change-resolver-symlink.md}{\texttt{ change-\/resolver-\/symlink}} allows users to change the default resolver.
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-change-storage-symlink.md}{\texttt{ change-\/storage-\/symlink}} allows users to change the default storage.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item limit min/max depth for {\ttfamily kdb ls} ({\ttfamily -\/mM}), thanks to Armin Wurzinger.
\item conditionals\+: allow multiple assigns and conditions
\item base64 also works as filter for binary data (not just encrypted data), thanks to René Schwaiger
\item \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/csvstorage}{\texttt{ csvstorage plugin}}\+: compatibility with RFC 4180, thanks to Thomas Waser

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3010}{}\doxysection{Compatibility}\label{doc_news_2017-10-31_0_8_20_md_autotoc_md3010}
As always, the ABI and API of kdb.\+h is fully compatible, i.\+e. programs compiled against an older 0.\+8 version of Elektra will continue to work (ABI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (API).

We added {\ttfamily explicit} to some C++ constructors in libtools and internally moved some typedefs. Modules\+Plugin\+Database now has protected members (instead of private). This might break code in special cases, but should not affect binary compatibility. As always we tested for binary compatibility. This time we had to revert some changes to keep libelektra-\/tools ABI compatible.

Furthermore\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item scripts now work on mac\+OS (readlink and sed), thanks to Armin Wurzinger and René Schwaiger
\item generalized error \#60, \char`\"{}invalid line encountered\char`\"{}
\item added new errors \#164 -\/ \#187
\item added private headerfiles {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{kdbglobal_8h}{kdbglobal.\+h}}}, {\ttfamily kdbinvoke.\+h}
