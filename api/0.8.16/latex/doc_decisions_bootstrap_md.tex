\subsection*{Issue}

Currently the default backend (default.\+ecf) will also be used for bootstrapping. There are two problems with this approach\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Thus the default backend first will be read with parent\+Key {\ttfamily system/elektra} and later with parent\+Key {\ttfamily system}, it needs to store absolute paths and thus won't work with the current I\+N\+I plugin
\item When {\ttfamily system} is large without mountpoints, everything is reread twice during bootstrapping.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Constraints}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item be compatible to mountpoints stored in {\ttfamily defaults.\+ecf}
\item nice migration phase
\item new setups should never bother about the compatibility mode
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Assumptions}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bootstrap should be fast and not unnecessarily read large files
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Considered Alternatives}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Implement a hack so that {\ttfamily system/elektra} is actually read as {\ttfamily system}. (Will not solve problem 2.)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Its a hack.
\item Its confusing and does not play well with persistent data with relative key names.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Split up without compatibility mode\+: would need to migrate all mountpoints by exporting (with old version!) and then importing (with new version!)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I consider this too error prone, people might easily forget to export with the old version and then discard their mountpoints unintentional.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Decision}

Split up the concepts of default ({\ttfamily default.\+ecf}) and bootstrap ({\ttfamily elektra.\+ecf}) backend. During bootstrap only {\ttfamily elektra.\+ecf} is read. The default backend reading {\ttfamily default.\+ecf} is only relevant as long as no root backend is mounted.

Algorithm\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item try to get system/elektra using the file elektra.\+ecf (K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+B\+\_\+\+I\+N\+I\+T)
\item if it works, mount the init backend to system/elektra (non-\/fallback mode)
\item if it fails (== 0 or == -\/1), try default.\+ecf as fallback
\item if the fallback works (i.\+e. keys are present in system/elektra), mount the default backend to system/elektra (fallback mode)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Argument}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Solves both problems
\item Is fully compatible with any existing setup
\item People can decide if and how to migrate
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Implications}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fallback mode should be removed with 1.\+0
\item added scripts/upgrade-\/bootstrap
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Related decisions}

\subsection*{Notes}

to upgrade to new system, either\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item touch /etc/kdb/elektra.ecf (loses old mountpoints)
\item or do kdb export system/elektra/mountpoints, kdb rm -\/r system/elektra/mountpoints, kdb import system/elektra/mountpoints 
\end{DoxyItemize}
