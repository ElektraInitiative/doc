src_plugins_README_mdelektra-plugins(7) -- plugins overview 
 \- Multiple plugins can be mounted into the \fBkey database\fP (KDB)\&. On every access to the key data base they are executed and thus can change the functionality and behavior\&.
.PP
Unlike Elektra's core the plugins have all kinds of dependencies\&. It is the responsibility of the plugin to find and check its dependencies using CMake\&. If a dependency cannot be found, the plugin will automatically disable itself\&.
.PP
Elektra has a wide range of different plugins\&. The plugin folders should contain a README\&.md with further information\&. (Or follow links below\&.) The plugins are:
.PP
Overview Plugins 
.PP
All plugins implement the same interface:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC\fBkdbOpen()\fP\fP calls \fC\fBelektraPluginOpen()\fP\fP of every plugin to let them do their initialisation\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC\fBkdbGet()\fP\fP requests \fCelektraPluginGet()\fP of every plugin in the queried backends to return a key set\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC\fBkdbSet()\fP\fP usually calls \fCelektraPluginSet()\fP of every plugin in the queried backends to store the configuration\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC\fBkdbSet()\fP\fP also calls \fCelektraPluginError()\fP for every plugin when an error happens\&. Because of \fCelektraPluginError()\fP, plugins are guaranteed to have their chance for necessary cleanups\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC\fBkdbClose()\fP\fP makes sure that plugins can finally free their own resources in \fCelektraPluginClose()\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
Furthermore, plugins might export symbols:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCcheckconf\fP can be called during mounting to ensure a plugin has valid configuration\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCgenconf\fP can be called to produce all valid configurations of a plugin\&.
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
To list all plugins use \fBkdb-plugin-list(1)\fP\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
To check a plugin use \fBkdb-plugin-check(1)\fP\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
For information on a plugin use \fBkdb-plugin-info(1)\fP\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
For mount plugin(s) use \fBkdb-mount(1)\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
For an easy introduction, see \fBthis tutorial how to write a storage plugin\fP\&. For more background information of the \fBplugins framework, continue here\fP\&. Otherwise, you can visit the \fCthe API documentation\fP\&.
.PP
Before configuration is actually written, the file name needs to be determined (resolvers will be automatically added by kdb mount):
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBresolver\fP uses advanced POSIX APIs to handle conflicts gracefully
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBnoresolver\fP does not resolve as no file name is needed (for non-file storage plugins)
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBwresolver\fP minimalistic resolver for non-POSIX systems
.PP
.PP
Furthermore, there are following experimental resolvers:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2

.PP
Read and write everything a KeySet might contain:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdump\fP makes a dump of a KeySet in an Elektra-specific format
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBquickdump\fP uses binary portable format based on \fBdump\fP, but more efficient

.PP
Using semi-structured data for config files, mainly suitable for spec-namespace (put a focus on having nice syntax for metadata):
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBni\fP parses INI files based on (including metadata) \fCni\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
Only suited for import/export:
.PP

.PP
.PP

.PP
.PP
Information compiled in Elektra:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2

.PP
.PP
\fIFilter plugins\fP process keys and their values in both directions\&. In one direction they undo what they do in the other direction\&. Most filter plugins available now encode and decode values\&. Storage plugins that use characters to separate key names, values or metadata will not work without them\&.
