\subsection*{Usage}

The recommended way is to globally mount the plugin together with the dbus plugin\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
kdb global-mount dbus dbusrecv
\end{DoxyCode}


This plugin is designed to be used as a transport plugin for Elektra\textquotesingle{}s notification feature. If notification is not enabled (i.\+e. in the tool {\ttfamily kdb} or in any other application that does not use {\ttfamily \hyperlink{group__kdbnotification_gaeae96154abdb5fdbf1b34a01e2b23e44}{elektra\+Notification\+Open()}}) this plugin performs no actions.

This plugin cannot be directly used to receive notifications. Applications that use the notification feature implicitly use it when this plugin is mounted globally.

\section*{Transport Plugin}

Mount this plugin globally with default settings to use it as {\itshape receiving} transport plugin for Elektra\textquotesingle{}s notification feature\+:

\begin{quote}
kdb global-\/mount dbusrecv \end{quote}
