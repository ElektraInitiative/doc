.SH NAME
doc_dev_kdb-contracts_md \- KDB Contracts 
 The \fC\fBkdbOpen()\fP\fP function accepts a \fCKeySet * contract\fP parameter\&. This parameter allows you to extend and configure the KDB within your application without permanently changing files on disk\&.
.SH "Contract Structure"
.PP
The contract consists of Keys below \fCsystem:/elektra/contract/<type>\fP, where \fC<type>\fP is one of a set of predefined contract types\&. Currently, the types \fCglobalkeyset\fP and \fCmountglobal\fP are supported\&.
.SS "Global KeySet Contracts"
To insert data into the global KeySet during \fCkdbOpen\fP, you can add keys below \fCsystem:/elektra/contract/globalkeyset\fP\&. All these keys will be renamed and copied into the global KeySet that is passed to all plugins\&.
.PP
Specifically, the subset below \fCsystem:/elektra/contract/globalkeyset\fP is moved to \fCsystem:/elektra\fP and then inserted into the global KeySet\&.
.SS "Mounting Global Plugins"
You can also mount a global plugin with a contract\&. To do this, add a key \fCsystem:/elektra/contract/mountglobal/<plugin>\fP where \fC<plugin>\fP is the name of the plugin you want to mount\&. The keys below \fCsystem:/elektra/contract/mountglobal/<plugin>\fP will be moved to \fCuser:/\fP and used as the config for \fC<plugin>\fP\&.
.SH "Pre-defined Contracts"
.PP
There are a few pre-defined contracts that can be accessed via helper functions\&.
.SS "GOpts"
To mount and configure the \fCgopts\fP plugin you can use \fCelektraGOptsContract\fP\&. There is also \fCelektraGOptsContractFromStrings\fP, but its use is discouraged unless you really need it\&. It mainly exists for use from various bindings\&.
.SS "I/O binding"
To set the I/O binding to be used in a KDB instance, use \fCelektraIoContract\fP\&.
.SS "Notification"
To set up notifications use the \fCelektraNotificationContract\fP function\&. It automatically sets up the \fCinternalnotification\fP plugin\&.
.PP
If you also need to set up notification transport plugins, you should manually add the relevant \fCsystem:/elektra/contract/mountglobal/<plugin>\fP keys and the required config below\&.
