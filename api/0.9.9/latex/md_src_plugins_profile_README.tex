Following the elektra keyname convention application configurations are stored under {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#} and {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current}is the profile to be used. The {\ttfamily profile} plugin provides an easy way to switch configuration profiles.

The key {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile} defines what profile should be used as {\ttfamily current}, e.\+g. {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile = myprofile}. If a key {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key} is found and no key {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key} exists an override key will be created linking {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/currrent/key} to {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/myapp/key} If neither {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key} nor {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key} is found, but {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%/key}, {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key} will be linked to {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%/key}.

So a cascading lookup will automatically implement following preferences (next to the namespace preferences)\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Usage of key in {\ttfamily current}
\item Usage of key in the profile set with {\ttfamily profile}
\item Usage of key in the {\ttfamily \%} fallback profile
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_profile_README_autotoc_md404}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{md_src_plugins_profile_README_autotoc_md404}
See \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_INSTALL_md}{installation}}. The package is called {\ttfamily libelektra5-\/extra}.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_profile_README_autotoc_md405}{}\doxysection{Example}\label{md_src_plugins_profile_README_autotoc_md405}
Suppose we have the configuration file {\ttfamily profile.\+ini} in {\ttfamily $\sim$/.config}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cat profile.ini}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> []}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> profile = myprofile}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> [current]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> key2 = will win}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> [myprofile]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> key1 = test1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> key2 = test2}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> [\%]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> key2 = failed?}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> key3 = test3}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then we simply mount it {\itshape without} the profile plugin\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb mount profile.ini /sw/org/myapp/\#0 ini}

\end{DoxyCode}


But we have to make sure that the profile plugin is mounted globally\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb global-\/mount profile}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then we can access {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0} in a profile-\/aware way\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb ls /sw}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> spec:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> spec:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key3}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%/key2}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%/key3}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key2}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key2}

\end{DoxyCode}


As we can see with the {\ttfamily -\/v} option, we will fetch keys from our {\ttfamily myprofile} even though we request {\ttfamily current}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb get -\/v /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> got 25 keys}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> searching spec:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key1, found: spec:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key1, options: KDB\_O\_CALLBACK}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> The resulting keyname is user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key1}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#> test1}

\end{DoxyCode}


To switch profile we simply have to set one key\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb set user:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile newprofile}

\end{DoxyCode}


Usually, this will be done via commandline by setting {\ttfamily proc\+:/sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile}.
