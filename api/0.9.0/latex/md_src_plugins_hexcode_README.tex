This code plugin translates each unwanted character into a two cypher hexadecimal character. The escape character itself always needs to be encoded, otherwise the plugin would try to interpret the following two characters in the text as a hexadecimal sequence.

\subsection*{Restrictions}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The escape character itself always needs to be encoded, otherwise the plugin would try to interpret the following two characters in the text as a hexadecimal sequence.
\item The length of the resulting string increases. In the worst case the hexcode plugin makes the value three times larger.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Example}

Consider the following {\itshape value} of an key\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
value=abc xyz
\end{DoxyCode}


Assuming the escape character is \% the input would be encoded to\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
value%3Dabc%20xyz
\end{DoxyCode}


The disadvantage is that the length of the resulting string increases. In the worst case the hexcode plugin makes the value three times larger.

\subsection*{Usage}

Add {\ttfamily hexcode} to {\ttfamily infos/needs} for any plugin that you want to be filtered by hexcode.

Then, additionally define all characters you need to be escaped below {\ttfamily config/needs/chars} in your contract, e.\+g\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
config/needs/chars/20 = 61
\end{DoxyCode}


to transform a space (dec 20) to the escaped letter a (dec 61).

The escape letter itself can be changed by setting\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
config/needs/escape
\end{DoxyCode}
