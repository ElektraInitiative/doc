Currently, you can easily come into wrong assumptions that something would work in the specification.

We need to find minimal requirements to implement a sane spec plugin.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item no defaults for {\ttfamily sw/\+\_\+/key} specifications (default will not work for {\ttfamily ks\+Lookup(/sw/sthg/key)})
\item plugins are not allowed to create keys (may change in future; depends on plugin positions)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The spec plugin should yield errors when it detects such situations.
