\subsection*{Problem}

There is a different behavior of various plugins whether their name is absolute or relative, including\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item mounting the same file somewhere else does not work
\item importing somewhere else (other than from where it was exported) does not work (See \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/51}{\tt here})
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Constraints}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item at least the dump plugin must be able to handle its old files
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Assumptions}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item it still will be easy to support a workflow that exports/imports everything
\item mounting across namespaces (user/system) does not make sense
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Considered Alternatives}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item allow relative/absolute plugins and mark them what they are, tools (e.\+g. import/export) use this knowledge and react accordingly. This would still not solve issue 1.)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Decision}

Key names shall be relative to parent Key name

\subsection*{Rationale}

Provides a better import/export/remount and also a more uniform experience between different plugins.

\subsection*{Implications}

Plugins must be adapted to be relative as tracked \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/51}{\tt here}.

plugins should use relative paths so that import/export/remount works


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item dump
\item xmltool (also supports relative)
\item tcl
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Related Decisions}

None
