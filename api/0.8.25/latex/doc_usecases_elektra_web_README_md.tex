The path through the use cases is as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Setup instance
\item View config
\end{DoxyItemize}

Now we are in the main part of the application, and we can do the following use cases\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adding keys
\item Modifying keys
\item Drag \& Drop keys
\item Finding keys
\end{DoxyItemize}

Any of these use cases (except for finding because no change is made), are extended by the Key validation use case. After doing any of these use cases, we can do the Undo/\+Redo use case to revert them.
