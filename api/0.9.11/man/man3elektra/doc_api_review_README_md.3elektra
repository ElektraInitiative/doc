doc_api_review_README_md \- Elektra API Review 
 This folder contains all API design reviews conducted on LibElektra\&. Below you can find a short description of the review process\&.
.SH "Review Process"
.PP
This review is performed for each function separately\&. Each function should be evaluated according to the checklist\&. The reviewer judges for every bullet point, whether the function does / does not fulfill the bullet point\&. For every unfulfilled point a short explanation has to be given why the reviewer thinks the function does not fulfill the respective bullet point\&. This is done simply by providing a short description of the issue below the respective bullet point\&. After the review has been completed, the reviewer creates an issue for every unfulfilled bullet point so it can be fixed by the Elektra Initiative\&.
