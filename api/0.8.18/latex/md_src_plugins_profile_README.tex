Following the elektra keyname convention application configurations are stored under {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#} and {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current}is the profile to be used. The {\ttfamily profile} plugin provides an easy way to switch configuration profiles.

The key {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile} defines what profile should be used as {\ttfamily current}, e.\+g. {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile = myprofile}. If a key {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key} is found and no key {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key} exists an override key will be created linking {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/currrent/key} to {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/myapp/key} If neither {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key} nor {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key} is found, but {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%/key}, {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key} will be linked to {\ttfamily /sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%/key}.

So a cascading lookup will automatically implement following preferences (next to the namespace preferences)\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Usage of key in {\ttfamily current}
\item Usage of key in the profile set with {\ttfamily profile}
\item Usage of key in the {\ttfamily \%} fallback profile
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Suppose we have the configuration file profile.\+ini in $\sim$/.config\+:

\% cat profile.\+ini ``` \mbox{[}\mbox{]} profile = myprofile

\mbox{[}current\mbox{]} key2 = will win

\mbox{[}myprofile\mbox{]} key1 = test1 key2 = test2

\mbox{[}\%\mbox{]} key2 = failed? key3 = test3 ```

Then we simply mount it {\itshape without} the profile plugin\+:

\% kdb mount profile.\+ini /sw/org/myapp/\#0 ini

But we have to make sure that the profile plugin is mounted globally\+:

\% kdb global-\/mount profile

Then we can access /sw/org/myapp/\#0 in a profile-\/aware way\+:

\% kdb ls /sw ``` spec/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key1 spec/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key3 user/sw/org/myapp/\#0 user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/\% user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%/key2 user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/\%/key3 user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key2 user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key1 user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key2 ```

As we can see with the {\ttfamily -\/v} option, we will fetch keys from our {\ttfamily myprofile} even though we request {\ttfamily current}\+:

\% kdb get -\/v /sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key1 ``` got 25 keys searching spec/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key1, found\+: spec/sw/org/myapp/\#0/current/key1, options\+: K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+O\+\_\+\+C\+A\+L\+L\+B\+A\+C\+K The resulting keyname is user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/myprofile/key1 test1 ```

To switch profile we simply have to set one key\+: ``` kdb set user/sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile newprofile ```

Usually, this will be done via commandline by setting {\ttfamily proc/sw/org/myapp/\#0/profile}.
