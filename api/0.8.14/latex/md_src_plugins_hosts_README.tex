\end{DoxyItemize}

The /etc/hosts file is a simple text file that associates I\+P addresses with hostnames, one line per I\+P address. The format is described in hosts(5).

\subsection*{Special values}

\paragraph*{Hostnames}

Canonical hostnames are stored as key names with the I\+P address as key value.

\paragraph*{Aliases}

Aliases are stored as sub keys with a read only duplicate of the associated ip address as value.

\paragraph*{Comments}

Comments are stored according to the comment metadata specification (see doc/\+M\+E\+T\+A\+D\+A\+T\+A.\+ini for more information)

\paragraph*{Multi-\/\+Line Comments}

Since line breaks are preserved, you can identify multi line comments by their trailing line break.

\subsection*{Restrictions}

The ordering of the hosts is stored in meta keys of type \char`\"{}order\char`\"{}. The value is an ascending number. Ordering of aliases is N\+O\+T preserved.

\subsection*{Examples}

Print out all known hosts and their aliases\+: $>$\$ kdb ls system/hosts

Get I\+P address of host \char`\"{}localhost\char`\"{}\+: $>$\$ kdb get system/hosts/localhost Fetch comment belonging to host \char`\"{}localhost\char`\"{}\+: $>$\$ kdb getmeta system/hosts/localhost comment
