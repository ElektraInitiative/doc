\subsection*{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N}

This command copies key(s) in the Key database. You can copy keys to another directory within the database or even below another key. Note that you can't copy a key below itself.

Where {\ttfamily source} is the path of the key(s) you want to copy and {\ttfamily dest} is the path where you would like to copy the key(s) to. Note that when using the {\ttfamily -\/r} flag, {\ttfamily source} as well as all of the keys below it will be copied.
