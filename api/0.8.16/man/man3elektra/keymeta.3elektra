Methods to do various operations on Key meta data\&. 

To use them: 
.PP
.nf
#include <kdb\&.h>

.fi
.PP
.PP
Next to \fBName (key and owner) \fP and \fBValue (data and comment) \fP there is the so called meta information inside every key\&.
.PP
Key meta information are an unlimited number of key/value pairs strongly related to a key\&. It main purpose is to give keys special semantics, so that plugins can treat them differently\&.
.PP
Metakey, as opposed to Key, deliberately has following limitations:
.IP "\(bu" 2
no null values
.IP "\(bu" 2
no binary data
.IP "\(bu" 2
no modification of references (COW)
.IP "\(bu" 2
no guarantee of ordering
.PP
.PP
.SS "Examples for metadata"
.PP
File system information (see stat(2) for more information):
.IP "\(bu" 2
uid: the user id (positive number)
.IP "\(bu" 2
gid: the group id (positive number)
.IP "\(bu" 2
mode: filesystem-like mode permissions (positive octal number)
.IP "\(bu" 2
atime: When was the key accessed the last time\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
mtime: When was the key modified the last time\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
ctime: When the uid, gid or mode of a key changes\&. (times are represented through a positive number as unix timestamp)
.PP
.PP
The comment can contain userdata which directly belong to that key\&. The name of the meta information is 'comment' for a general purpose comment about the key\&. Multi-Language comments are also supported by appending [LANG] to the name\&.
.PP
Validators are regular expressions which are tested against the key value\&. The metakey 'validator' can hold a regular expression which will be matched against\&.
.PP
Types can be expressed with the meta information 'type'\&.
.PP
The relevance of the key can be tagged with a value from -20 to 20\&. Negative numbers are the more important and must be present in order to start the program\&.
.PP
A version of a key may be stored with 'version'\&. Its format is full\&.major\&.minor where all of these are integers\&.
.PP
The order inside a persistent storage can be described with the tag 'order' which contains a positive number\&.
.PP
The meta key 'app' describes to which application a key belongs\&. It can be used to remove keys from an application no longer installed\&.
.PP
The meta key 'path' describes where the key is physically stored\&.
.PP
The 'owner' is the user that owns the key\&. It only works for the user/ hierarchy\&. It rather says where the key is stored and says nothing about the filesystem properties\&. 
.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "int keyCopyAllMeta (Key *dest, const Key *source)"

.PP
Do a shallow copy of all meta data from source to dest\&. The key dest will additionally have all meta data the source had\&. Meta data not present in source will not be changed\&. Meta data which was present in source and dest will be overwritten\&.
.PP
For example the meta data type is copied into the Key k:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void l (Key * k)
{
        // receive c
        keyCopyAllMeta (k, c);
        // the caller will see the changed key k
        // with all the metadata from c
}
.fi
.PP
 The main purpose of this function is for plugins or applications which want to add the same meta data to n keys\&. When you do that with \fBkeySetMeta()\fP it will take n times the memory for the key\&. This can be considerable amount of memory for many keys with some meta data for each\&.
.PP
To avoid that problem you can use \fBkeyCopyAllMeta()\fP or \fBkeyCopyMeta()\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
void o (KeySet * ks)
{
        Key * current;
        Key * shared = keyNew (0);
        keySetMeta (shared, "shared1", "this meta data should be shared among many keys");
        keySetMeta (shared, "shared2", "this meta data should be shared among many keys also");
        keySetMeta (shared, "shared3", "this meta data should be shared among many keys too");

        ksRewind (ks);
        while ((current = ksNext (ks)) != 0)
        {
                if (needsSharedData (current)) keyCopyAllMeta (current, shared);
        }

        keyDel (shared);
}
.fi

.SS "int keyCopyMeta (Key *dest, const Key *source, const char *metaName)"

.PP
Do a shallow copy of meta data from source to dest\&. The key dest will have the same meta data referred with metaName afterwards then source\&.
.PP
For example the meta data type is copied into the Key k\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
1 void l(Key *k)
2 {
3         // receive c
4         keyCopyMeta(k, c, "type");

6         // with the metadata "type" from c

.SS "const Key* keyGetMeta (const Key *key, const char *metaName)"

.PP
Returns the Value of a Meta-Information given by name\&. This is a much more efficient version of \fBkeyGetMeta()\fP\&. But unlike with keyGetMeta you are not allowed to modify the resulting string\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf

.PP

.SS "const Key* keyNextMeta (Key *key)"

.PP
Iterate to the next meta information\&. Keys have an internal cursor that can be reset with \fBkeyRewindMeta()\fP\&. Every time \fBkeyNextMeta()\fP is called the cursor is incremented and the new current Name of Meta Information is returned\&.
.PP
You'll get a NULL pointer if the meta information after the end of the Key was reached\&. On subsequent calls of \fBkeyNextMeta()\fP it will still return the NULL pointer\&.
.PP
The \fCkey\fP internal cursor will be changed, so it is not const\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
That the resulting key is guaranteed to have a value, because meta information has no binary or null pointer semantics\&.
.PP
You must not delete or change the returned key, use \fBkeySetMeta()\fP if you want to delete or change it\&.

.SS "int keyRewindMeta (Key *key)"

.PP
Rewind the internal iterator to first meta data\&. Use it to set the cursor to the beginning of the Key Meta Infos\&. \fBkeyCurrentMeta()\fP will then always return NULL afterwards\&. So you want to \fBkeyNextMeta()\fP first\&.

Will add a new Pair for Meta-Information if metaName was not added up to now\&.
