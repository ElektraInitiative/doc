\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item no workaround such as {\ttfamily kdb get -\/a}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item global plugin can register additional backends to load
\item split {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} into multiple steps\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item do {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} on {\ttfamily system/elektra} to update mount points
\item first do {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} on the {\ttfamily spec/}-\/namespace
\item then calculate which backends are needed
\item then fetch all backends as needed
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item split loops in {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} not only according placements but also according namespace (get spec first)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item always load everything (with mmap)
