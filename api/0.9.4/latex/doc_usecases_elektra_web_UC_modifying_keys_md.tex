\item {\bfseries Precondition\+:} View configuration of an instance.
\item {\bfseries Main success scenario\+:} User edits a key\textquotesingle{}s contents in a field that is specifically formatted according to its metadata (e.\+g. number/date fields vs string fields with regex validation). Arrays are specifically formatted as lists of fields under a key. A description of the key is also shown.
\item {\bfseries Alternative scenario\+:} User enters data that fails the field validation, the input field is marked as invalid (e.\+g. with a red color and some information text) and the data is {\itshape not} sent to the backend.
\item {\bfseries Error scenario\+:} Technical problems while persisting to the key database. The user is informed about the problem.
\item {\bfseries Postcondition\+:} The updated key is persisted to the database.
