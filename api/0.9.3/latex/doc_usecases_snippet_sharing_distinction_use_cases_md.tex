Currently it is not planned to support scoring or rating of snippets. That means it is not possible to retrieve the most viewed, best rated or most often downloaded snippets.

It is not planned to support batch manipulation, i.\+e. editing of several snippets at once or similar actions. If a feature like this will be implemented at some point, then as frontend only feature, resulting in multiple A\+PI requests.

A feature to convert snippets in between formats will be implemented, although it will not support intermediate transformation via script languages like lua/python.

It is not possible to invalidate sessions. This means that although the logout on the frontend is possible, the underlying session would still be active. A stateless server may not store any state information, therefore the session token has to be stored client side. The server has to accept all tokens he gave out for a certain period of time. This is also a known M\+I\+TM vulnerability that is impossible to fix.
