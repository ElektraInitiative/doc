Some components of {\ttfamily kdb\+Get}/{\ttfamily kdb\+Set} should be optional. We use the plugin system for that. However, some of these cases cannot be tied to a mountpoint. This was the idea of global plugins, but that idea proved problematic. In the old global plugins implementation\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Notification does not happen once after final commit, but for every plugin.
\item Problems in spec plugin
\end{DoxyItemize}

These problems can be traced back to the placement of the plugins. We need to clean up and simplify the placement.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_5_partially_implemented_hooks_md_autotoc_md2192}{}\doxysection{Constraints}\label{doc_decisions_5_partially_implemented_hooks_md_autotoc_md2192}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Plugin interface should be the same. Many plugins, where appropriate, e.\+g. dbus, should work as global plugins w/o any change in code (i.\+e. only changes in contract)
\item Global plugins might depend on specific applications or specific mount points (it should be possible to enforce global plugins for specific applications).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Only following plugins need hook functionality\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item mmap
\item spec
\item gopts
\item receiving of notifications (internalnotification)
\item sending of notifications (dbus, ...)
\item recording of changes
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item generic placements like /prerollback /rollback /postrollback /getresolver /pregetcache /pregetstorage /getstorage /postgetstorage /postgetcache /setresolver /presetstorage /setstorage /precommit /commit /postcommit which can be executed at\+: /init /deinit /foreach proved to be too complicated and difficult to test.

Have hooks and APIs specific for plugins listed in assumptions. These hooks are not shared, so no {\ttfamily list} plugin is needed.

Installed plugins will be used.

We\textquotesingle{}ll hard code the names of the plugins. For changing those plugins symlinks will have to be used.\hypertarget{doc_decisions_5_partially_implemented_hooks_md_autotoc_md2196}{}\doxysection{Rationale}\label{doc_decisions_5_partially_implemented_hooks_md_autotoc_md2196}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item allows adding more types of plugins later, also post-\/1.\+0
\item much clearer semantics for each type, no need to compromise
\item easier to implement
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{doc_decisions_5_partially_implemented_hooks_md_autotoc_md2197}{}\doxysection{Implications}\label{doc_decisions_5_partially_implemented_hooks_md_autotoc_md2197}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item remove {\ttfamily global-\/mount} command
\item command for mmap/notification/... enable disable (like current {\ttfamily kdb cache} tool)
\item remove {\ttfamily list} plugin
\item remove plugins that stop working or disallow global positioning for them
\item call {\ttfamily spec} as needed several times
\item remove current global plugins mechanism
\item rename {\ttfamily global} to {\ttfamily hook} in contract
