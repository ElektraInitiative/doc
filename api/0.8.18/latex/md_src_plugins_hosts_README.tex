\end{DoxyItemize}

The /etc/hosts file is a simple text file that associates I\+P addresses with hostnames, one line per I\+P address. The format is described in hosts(5).

\subsection*{Special values}

\paragraph*{Hostnames}

Canonical hostnames are stored as key names with the I\+P address as key value.

\paragraph*{Aliases}

Aliases are stored as sub keys with a read only duplicate of the associated ip address as value.

\paragraph*{Comments}

Comments are stored according to the comment metadata specification (see doc/\+M\+E\+T\+A\+D\+A\+T\+A.\+ini for more information)

\paragraph*{Multi-\/\+Line Comments}

Since line breaks are preserved, you can identify multi line comments by their trailing line break.

\subsection*{Restrictions}

The ordering of the hosts is stored in meta keys of type \char`\"{}order\char`\"{}. The value is an ascending number. Ordering of aliases is N\+O\+T preserved.

\subsection*{Examples}

Mount the plugin\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ kdb mount --with-recommends /etc/hosts system/hosts hosts
\end{DoxyVerb}


Print out all known hosts and their aliases\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ kdb ls system/hosts
\end{DoxyVerb}


Get I\+P address of ipv4 host \char`\"{}localhost\char`\"{}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ kdb get system/hosts/ipv4/localhost
\end{DoxyVerb}


Check if a comment is belonging to host \char`\"{}localhost\char`\"{}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ kdb lsmeta system/hosts/ipv4/localhost
\end{DoxyVerb}


Try to change the host \char`\"{}localhost\char`\"{}, should fail because it is not an ipv4 adress\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ kdb set system/hosts/ipv4/localhost ::1\end{DoxyVerb}
