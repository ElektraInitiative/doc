{\ttfamily kdb cp $<$source$>$ $<$dest$>$}

This command copies key(s) in the Key database. You can copy keys to another directory within the database or even below another key. Note that you cannot copy a key below itself.

Where {\ttfamily source} is the path of the key(s) you want to copy and {\ttfamily dest} is the path where you would like to copy the key(s) to. Note that when using the {\ttfamily -\/r} flag, {\ttfamily source} as well as all of the keys below it will be copied.

Neither {\ttfamily source} nor {\ttfamily dest} can be a cascading key. (Start with {\ttfamily /}). Make sure to select a namespace.

This command will return the following values as an exit status\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0\+: No errors.
\item 1-\/10\+: standard exit codes, see \hyperlink{doc_help_kdb_md}{kdb(1)}
\item 11\+: No key to copy found.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/H}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/help}\+: Show the man page.
\item {\ttfamily -\/V}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/version}\+: Print version info.
\item {\ttfamily -\/p}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/profile $<$profile$>$}\+: Use a different kdb profile.
\item {\ttfamily -\/C}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/color $<$when$>$}\+: Print never/auto(default)/always colored output.
\item {\ttfamily -\/r}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/recursive}\+: Recursively copy keys.
\item {\ttfamily -\/v}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/verbose}\+: Explain what is happening. Prints additional information in case of errors/warnings.
\item {\ttfamily -\/d}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/debug}\+: Give debug information. Prints additional debug information in case of errors/warnings.
\item {\ttfamily -\/f}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/force}\+: Force overwriting the keys.

# To copy a single key:
kdb cp user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/key user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/key2
#>

# To copy multiple keys:
kdb cp -r user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/key user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/copied
#>

# If the target-key already exists and has a different value, cp fails:
kdb cp -r user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/key user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/cpkeyerror
# RET: 11

# If the target-key already exists and has the same value as the source, everything is fine:
kdb cp -r user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/key user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/cpkey
#>

# To force the copy of keys:
kdb cp -rf user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/key user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/cpkeyerror
#>

# Now the key-values of /cpkeyerror are overwritten:
kdb export user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/cpkeyerror mini
#> =key1
#> first=key
#> second=key

# To copy keys below an existing key:
kdb cp -r user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/another user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/another/key
#>

kdb rm -r user/tests/cp/examples/kdb-cp/
