.SH NAME
md_doc_help_kdb-getkdb-get(1) -- Get the value of a key stored in the key database 
 \- \fCkdb get <key name>\fP
.PP
Where \fCkey name\fP is the name of the key\&.
.PP
.SS "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command is used to retrieve the value of a key\&.
.PP
If you enter a \fCkey name\fP starting with a leading \fC/\fP, then a cascading lookup will be performed in order to attempt to locate the key\&. In this case, using the \fC-v\fP option allows the user to see the full key name of the key if it is found\&.
.PP
Note: There is a current limitation where only keys that are mounted will be considered during a cascading lookup\&. A workaround that will lookup all keys is to pass the \fC-a\fP option\&. Additionally, a user can use the command \fCkdb ls <same key>\fP to see if an override or a fallback will be considered by the lookup\&.

\fC-H\fP, \fC--help\fP: Show the man page\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-V\fP, \fC--version\fP: Print version info\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-p\fP, \fC--profile <profile>\fP: Use a different kdb profile\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-C\fP, \fC--color <when>\fP: Print never/auto(default)/always colored output\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-a\fP, \fC--all\fP: Consider all of the keys\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-n\fP, \fC--no-newline\fP: Suppress the newline at the end of the output\&.

.SS "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To get the value of a key: \fCkdb get user/example/key\fP
.PP
To get the value of a key using a cascading lookup: \fCkdb get /example/key\fP
.PP
To get the value of a key without adding a newline to the end of it: \fCkdb get -n /example/key\fP
.PP
To explain why a specific key was used (for cascading keys): \fCkdb get -v /example/key\fP
.PP
To use bookmarks: \fCkdb get +kdb/format\fP
.PP
This command will actually get \fCuser/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/format\fP if the bookmarks commands from \fBkdb-set(1)\fP man pages are executed before\&.
