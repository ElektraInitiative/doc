Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store configuration parameters in a global, hierarchical key database.

The core is a small library implemented in C. The plugin-\/based framework fulfills many configuration-\/related tasks to avoid any unnecessary code duplication across applications while it still allows the core to stay minimal without any external dependency. Elektra abstracts from cross-\/platform-\/related issues with a consistent A\+PI, and allows applications to be aware of other applications\textquotesingle{} configurations, leveraging easy application integration.

The man pages can also be viewed online at\+: \href{https://doc.libelektra.org/api/current/html/pages.html}{\tt https\+://doc.\+libelektra.\+org/api/current/html/pages.\+html}

Concepts are in man page section 7 and are prefixed with {\ttfamily elektra-\/}. You should start reading \hyperlink{md_doc_help_elektra-introduction_doc_help_elektra-introduction_md}{elektra-\/introduction(7)}.

Tools are in man page section 1 and are prefixed with {\ttfamily kdb-\/}. You should start reading \hyperlink{md_doc_help_kdb-introduction_doc_help_kdb-introduction_md}{kdb-\/introduction(1)}.

Documentation of plugins is available using the \hyperlink{md_doc_help_kdb-info_doc_help_kdb-info_md}{kdb-\/info(1)} tool. Run {\ttfamily kdb list} for a list of plugins.

\subsection*{B\+A\+S\+IC O\+P\+T\+I\+O\+NS}

Every core-\/tool has the following options\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/H}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/help}\+: Show the man page.
\item {\ttfamily -\/V}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/version}\+: Print version info.
\item {\ttfamily -\/p}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/profile $<$profile$>$}\+: Use a different kdb profile, see below.
\item {\ttfamily -\/C}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/color $<$when$>$}\+: Print never/auto(default)/always colored output.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{C\+O\+M\+M\+ON O\+P\+T\+I\+O\+NS}

Most tools have the following options\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/v}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/verbose}\+: Explain what is happening.
\item {\ttfamily -\/q}, {\ttfamily -\/-\/quiet}\+: Suppress non-\/error messages.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{K\+DB}

The {\ttfamily kdb} utility reads its own configuration from three sources within the K\+DB (key database)\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item /sw/kdb/$\ast$$\ast$profile$\ast$$\ast$/ (for legacy configuration)
\item /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/\%/ (for empty profile, {\ttfamily \%} in Elektra is used to represent a emptiness)
\item /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/$\ast$$\ast$profile$\ast$$\ast$/ (for current profile, if no {\ttfamily -\/p} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/profile} is given, {\ttfamily current} will be used)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Here the last source where a configuration value is found, wins.

For example, to permanently change verbosity one can use\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily kdb set /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/current/verbose 1}\+: Be verbose for every tool.
\item {\ttfamily kdb set /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/current/quiet 1}\+: Be quiet for every tool.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If {\ttfamily \%} is passed to {\ttfamily -\/p} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/profile}, the K\+DB will not be consulted for configuration and only the command-\/line arguments are used.

\subsection*{P\+R\+O\+F\+I\+L\+ES}

Profiles allow users to change many/all configuration settings of a tool at once. It influences from where the K\+DB entries are read. Without a {\ttfamily -\/p} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/profile} argument following profiles are used (in the order of preference)\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily current}\+: Is the profile to be used only if no {\ttfamily -\/p} argument was used.
\item {\ttfamily \%}\+: Is the fallback profile. It will be used if keys cannot be found in the main profile.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For example if you use\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily kdb export -\/p admin system}

It will read its format configuration from {\ttfamily /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/admin/format}.

If you want different configuration per user or directories, you should prefer to use the {\ttfamily user} and {\ttfamily dir} namespaces. Then the correct configuration will be chosen automatically according to the current user or current working directory.

Sometimes it is useful to start with default options, for example it is not possible to invert the {\ttfamily -\/q} option. In such situations one can simply select a non-\/existing profile, then {\ttfamily -\/q} works as usual\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily kdb mount -\/p nonexist -\/q /abc dir/abc}

If {\ttfamily \%} is used as profile name for {\ttfamily -\/p}, the {\ttfamily kdb} tools disables reading from {\ttfamily K\+DB} for their own configuration settings. Then, they only use command-\/line arguments.

To explicitly state the default behavior, we use\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily -\/p current}

To state that we do not want to read any configuration settings for {\ttfamily kdb} from K\+DB, we use\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily -\/p \%}

\begin{quote}
Note that K\+DB will still be used to perform the actions you want to perform with the {\ttfamily kdb} tool. \end{quote}


\subsection*{B\+O\+O\+K\+M\+A\+R\+KS}

Elektra recommends \hyperlink{doc_tutorials_application-integration_md}{to use rather long paths} because it ensures flexibility in the future (e.\+g. to use profiles and have a compatible path for new major versions of configuration).

Long paths are, however, cumbersome to enter in the C\+LI. Thus one can define bookmarks. Bookmarks are keys whose key name starts with {\ttfamily +}. They are only recognized by the {\ttfamily kdb} tool or tools that explicit have support for it. Your applications should not depend on the presence of a bookmark.

Bookmarks are stored below\+: {\ttfamily /sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/current/bookmarks}

For every key found there, a new bookmark will be introduced.

Bookmarks can be used to start key names by using {\ttfamily +} (plus) as first character. The string until the first {\ttfamily /} will be considered as bookmark.

For example, if you set the bookmark kdb\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    kdb set user/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/bookmarks
    kdb set user/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/bookmarks/kdb user/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current
\end{DoxyVerb}


You are able to use\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    kdb ls +kdb/bookmarks
    kdb get +kdb/format
\end{DoxyVerb}
