Returns success on every call and can be used as resolver.

It also exports a function checks if a filename is valid. It returns 1 for a relative path and 0 for an absolute path (always successfully).

The path passed to the storage plugin via the parent key is exactly the value that was set during mounting. This plugin {\itshape does not} resolve any paths. If a relative path was set while mounting, storage plugins may treat it as relative to the current working directory.
