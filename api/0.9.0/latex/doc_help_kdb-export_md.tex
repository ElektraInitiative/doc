\subsection*{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+ON}

This command allows a user to export keys from the key database.~\newline
 Keys are exported to {\ttfamily stdout} in whichever format is specified.~\newline
 This command can also be used to view full key(s) including their values.~\newline


\subsection*{U\+S\+A\+GE}

Where {\ttfamily source} is the path of the key(s) you want to export. Additionally, the user can specify a format to use by passing it as the option argument {\ttfamily format}.~\newline
 The {\ttfamily format} attribute relies on Elektra’s plugin system to export the keys in the desired format.\+The user can view all plugins available for use by running the kdb-\/list(1) command. To learn about any plugin, the user can simply use the kdb-\/info(1) command.~\newline
 The {\ttfamily storage} plugin can be configured at compile-\/time or changed by the link {\ttfamily libelektra-\/storage.\+so}.
