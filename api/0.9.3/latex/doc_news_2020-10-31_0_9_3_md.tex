We are proud to release Elektra 0.\+9.\+3. This release again brings us a big step towards Elektra 1.\+0. It introduces the new soon-\/to-\/be-\/default storage plugin\+: T\+O\+ML.

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database. For more information, visit \href{https://libelektra.org}{\tt https\+://libelektra.\+org}.

You can also read the news \href{https://www.libelektra.org/news/0.9.3-release}{\tt on our website}

You can try out the latest Elektra release using our docker image \href{https://hub.docker.com/r/elektra/elektra}{\tt elektra/elektra}. This is the quickest way to get started with Elektra without compiling and other obstacles, simply run {\ttfamily docker run -\/it elektra/elektra}.

The highlight of this release is the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/toml}{\tt T\+O\+ML plugin}. The T\+O\+ML plugin has a similar huge feature set as the I\+NI plugin, but is written in a much cleaner and more maintainable way using flex and bison. Furthermore, it follows the popular \href{https://toml.io}{\tt T\+O\+ML spec}.

It has nearly no run-\/time dependency, it only needs {\ttfamily base64} if binary values are needed.

A huge thanks to Jakob Fischer for this amazing work!

\begin{quote}
Warning\+: In one of the following {\ttfamily 0.\+9.$\ast$} releases, I\+NI will be removed and T\+O\+ML will become the default plugin. If you are using I\+NI, please migrate to T\+O\+ML now. \end{quote}


The following section lists news about the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme}{\tt plugins} we updated in this release.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Values of K\+D\+B\+Stream changed to fit with elektra\+Key\+Flags\+: recompilation of application is needed. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added the T\+O\+ML plugin, which can read and write T\+O\+ML files using flex and bison. \+\_\+(\+Jakob Fischer)\+\_\+
\item Removed the {\ttfamily null} plugin dependency of the plugin. \+\_\+(\+Jakob Fischer)\+\_\+
\item The {\ttfamily type} metakey is now set for numbers on reading. \+\_\+(\+Jakob Fischer)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily dump} plugin got a major update. The new version can read old files, but only write new files. The new files {\bfseries cannot} be read by the old version of the plugin and will result in a \char`\"{}version error\char`\"{} message. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The new version stores keynames relative to the mountpoint, so exported {\ttfamily dump} files can now be imported into a different mountpoint. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily dump} no longer writes unnecessary zero-\/bytes into files. This means that as long as all key-\/values are human-\/readable, so is the {\ttfamily dump} output. This makes {\ttfamily dump} usable for tests and demo purposes, as it is a very simple format closely modelled after a Key\+Set\textquotesingle{}s structure. This also makes it much easier to manually fix broken {\ttfamily dump} files. You only need a text editor most of the time. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

Elektra {\ttfamily 0.\+9.$\ast$} does not make any compatibility promises, as we want a clean 1.\+0.\+0 release. In this release, we did the following changes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily keyswitch\+\_\+t} renamed to elektra\+Key\+Flags. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily option\+\_\+t} renamed to elektra\+Lock\+Flags and elektra\+Lookup\+Flags. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily cursor\+\_\+t} renamed to elektra\+Cursor. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
Note\+: We made this release before merging larger changes. Please expect more fundamental changes in the next releases. \end{quote}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved error messages. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using \href{https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme}{\tt various programming languages}. This section keeps you up to date with the multi-\/language support provided by Elektra.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Made examples work again. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix googletest framework path in debian configure script. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\item The fish completion script does not fail any more, if you try to complete a simple command that expects a namespace. For example, completing
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
kdb ls ‸
\end{DoxyCode}


with the tab key ({\ttfamily ⇥}) ({\ttfamily ‸} represents the current cursor position) should work correctly again. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The formatting scripts using prettier now use \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx}{\tt {\ttfamily npx}}, which is included in {\ttfamily npm} v5.\+2.\+0 or newer. This allows us to specify an exact version of prettier to use. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The {\ttfamily reformat-\/shell} script now accepts the alias {\ttfamily shfmt2}, in case {\ttfamily shfmt} v3 is needed for another project. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item The config for restyled.\+io now specifies the image to use for each formatter. This clearly reflects the version used for formatting. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item Add a release script to automate the release process. \+\_\+(\+Robert Sowula)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Updated \href{http://www.libelektra.org/docgettingstarted/goals}{\tt G\+O\+A\+L\+S.\+md}. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Describe hierarchy and limitations of \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/hosts}{\tt hosts plugin}. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item The Doxygen P\+DF documentation now also requires the packages
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily stix} (part of {\ttfamily texlive-\/fonts-\/extra}) and
\item {\ttfamily stmaryrd} (part of {\ttfamily texlive-\/science} or {\ttfamily texlive-\/math-\/extra}). \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Write down some fundamental decisions, mostly about key names and key set structure. \+\_\+(Markus Raab in discussions with Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+

\item Fixed the {\ttfamily is\+\_\+not\+\_\+rw\+\_\+storage} function. \+\_\+(\+Lukas Kilian)\+\_\+
\item We now ensure that the {\ttfamily check\+\_\+import} and {\ttfamily check\+\_\+export} tests run for at least one plugin. \+\_\+(\+Lukas Kilian)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily make uninstall} also uninstalls symlinks. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item {\ttfamily external-\/links.\+txt} and {\ttfamily extra\+\_\+install\+\_\+manifest.\+txt} are cleaned up at cmake runs. \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab)\+\_\+
\item Increased C\+Test timeout for {\ttfamily testscr\+\_\+check\+\_\+kdb\+\_\+internal\+\_\+suite} due to timouts reached on slow test machines. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added Alpine Linux docker image with latest Elektra installed. This image is published on docker hub as \href{https://hub.docker.com/r/elektra/elektra}{\tt elektra/elektra}. We will update the image for each Elektra release such that novices can easily test Elektra without compiling or installing. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
