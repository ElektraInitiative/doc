doc_tutorials_import_mdHow-To: kdb import 
 \- 
.SS "Introduction"
.PP
The kdb tool allows users to interact with Elektraâ€™s Key Database via the command line\&. This tutorial explains the import function of kdb\&. This command lets you import Keys from the Elektra Key Database\&.
.PP
The command to use kdb import is:
.PP
.PP
.nf
kdb import [options] destination [format]
.fi
.PP
.PP
In this command, \fCdestination\fP is where the imported Keys should be stored below\&. For instance, \fCkdb import system/imported\fP would store all the keys below \fCsystem/imported\fP\&. This command takes Keys from \fCstdin\fP to store them into the Elektra Key Database\&. Typically, it is used with a pipe to read in the Keys from a file\&.
.PP
.SS "Format"
.PP
The format argument can be a very powerful option to use with kdb import\&. The format argument allows a user to specify which plug-in is used to import the Keys into the Key Database\&. The user can specify any storage plug-in to serve as the format for the Keys to be imported\&. For instance, if a user wanted to import a \fC/etc/hosts\fP file into KDB without mounting it, they could use the command \fCcat /etc/hosts | kdb import system/hosts hosts\fP\&. This command would essentially copy the current hosts file into KDB, like mounting it\&. Unlike mounting it, changes to the Keys would not be reflected in the hosts file and vise versa\&.
.PP
.SS "Dump Format"
.PP
The dump does not rename keys by design\&. If a user exports a KeySet using dump using a command such as \fCkdb export system/backup > backup\&.ecf\fP, they can only import that keyset back into \fCsystem/backup\fP using a command like \fCcat backup\&.ecf | kdb import system/backup\fP\&.
.PP
.SS "Options"
.PP
The kdb import command only takes one special option \fC-s <name>\fP or alternatively \fC--strategy <name>\fP, which is used to specify a strategy\&.
.PP
.SS "Example"
.PP
.PP
.nf
cat backup\&.ecf | kdb import system/backup
.fi
.PP
.PP
This command would import all keys stored in the file \fCbackup\&.ecf\fP into the Key Database under \fCsystem/backup\fP\&.
.PP
In this example, \fCbackup\&.ecf\fP was exported from the KeySet using the dump format by using the command:
.PP
.PP
.nf
kdb export system/backup > backup\&.ecf
.fi
.PP
.PP
\fCbackup\&.ecf\fP contains all the information about the keys below \fCsystem/backup\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
$ cat backup\&.ecf
kdbOpen 1
ksNew 3
keyNew 19 0
system/backup/key1
keyMeta 7 1
binary
keyEnd
keyNew 19 0
system/backup/key2
keyMeta 7 1
binary
keyEnd
keyNew 19 0
system/backup/key3
keyMeta 7 1
binary
keyEnd
ksEnd
.fi
.PP
.PP
Before the import command, \fCsystem/backup\fP does not exists and no keys are contained there\&. After the import command, running the command \fCkdb ls system/backup\fP prints: 
.PP
.nf
    system/backup/key1
    system/backup/key2
    system/backup/key3
.fi
.PP
