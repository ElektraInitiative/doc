.PP
.PP
The process plugin uses the \fCpluginprocess\fP library in order to execute other plugins inside an own process\&. This is useful for runtimes or libraries that cannot be reinitialized in the same process after they have been used\&. It is also useful for plugins which cause memory leaks to be isolated in an own process\&.
.PP
.SS "Usage"
.PP
Mount this plugin and specify the plugin configuration parameter \fCplugin\fP to a plugin that exists on the system\&. The proxied plugin will then be executed in a separate process and this plugin handles the communication between the processes\&.
.PP
.SS "Dependencies"
.PP
The \fCpluginprocess\fP library, which is only available on POSIX environments currently\&.
.PP
.SS "Examples"
.PP
``\fC <h1>Mount the dump plugin a separate process via the process plugin to the cascading namespace\fP/examples/process` sudo kdb mount config\&.file /tests/process process plugin=dump
.PP
kdb set /tests/process/key value #> Using name user/tests/process/key #> Create a new key user/tests/process/key with string 'value'
.PP
kdb get /tests/process/key #> value
.PP
.SH "Undo modifications"
.PP
.PP
kdb rm -r /tests/process sudo kdb umount /tests/process ```
.PP
.SS "Limitations"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Currently only plugins that act on one of the above-mentioned \fCplacements\fP can be proxied successfully\&. Other metainformation like \fCneeds\fP or \fCprovides\fP or \fCrecommends\fP will not be available when proxying using this plugin\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
This plugin cannot act as a proxy for itself to prevent loops\&.
