{\ttfamily kdb vset $<$path$>$ $<$value$>$ $<$regex$>$ \mbox{[}$<$message$>$\mbox{]}}

Where {\ttfamily path} is the path to the key the user wishes to set, {\ttfamily value} is the value the user wishes to set, and {\ttfamily regex} is the regular expression that should be used for validation. The optional parameter {\ttfamily message} is a user-\/defined message that will be displayed when a user tries to set the key to a value that doesn't match the regular expression.

\subsection*{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N}

This command allows the user to set the value of a key and create a validation regular expression which future sets are checked against. This command supports regular expressions as defined in extended regular expressions. If a user tries to set a value that does not match the regular expression, a user-\/defined message is returned.

Note\+: In order for this command to work, the {\ttfamily validation} plugin must be mounted where the key resides.
