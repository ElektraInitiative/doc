.SH NAME
md_doc_help_kdb-get \- kdb-get(1) -- Get the value of a key stored in the key database 
\fCkdb get <path>\fP
.PP
Where \fCpath\fP is the full path to the key\&.
.PP
.SS "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command is used to retrieve the value of a key\&.
.PP
If you enter a \fCpath\fP starting with a leading \fC/\fP, then a cascading lookup will be performed in order to attempt to locate the key\&. In this case, using the \fC-v\fP option allows the user to see the full \fCpath\fP of the key if it is found\&.
.PP
Note: There is a current limitation where only keys that are mounted will be considered during a cascading lookup\&. A workaround that will lookup all keys is to pass the \fC-a\fP option\&. Additionally, a user can use the command \fCkdb ls <same key>\fP to see if an override or a fallback will be considered by the lookup\&.
