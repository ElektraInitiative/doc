Since \hyperlink{doc_decisions_library_split_md}{0.8.15} this folder contains multiple libraries\+:



\subsection*{Libelektra}

\begin{DoxyVerb}libelektra.so
\end{DoxyVerb}


Libelektra is now only a stub for legacy applications. It basically only links all previous libraries together. It should {\itshape not} be used for new applications or plugins.

\subsection*{Libfull}

\begin{DoxyVerb}libelektra-full.so
\end{DoxyVerb}


Contains all sources of Elektra linked to together in one large library. Useful if you do not want dynamically loaded plugins. Should only be used on embedded systems (where whole application stack is done by you) and for tests.

\subsection*{Libstatic}

\begin{DoxyVerb}libelektra-static.so
\end{DoxyVerb}


Contains all sources of Elektra linked to together in one large library. Useful if you need your application to be linked statically against Elektra. Should only be used on embedded systems (where whole application stack is done by you) and for tests.

\subsection*{Libkdb}

\begin{DoxyVerb}libelektra-kdb.so
<kdb.h> (kdb*)
\end{DoxyVerb}


Contains kdb$\ast$ symbols and applications should link against it.

\section*{Exported symbols}

Exported symbols are defined in libelektra-\/symbols.map. The function names must confirm to this naming to conventions to be externally visible, e.\+g., for unit tests.

Please avoid exposing internal interfaces and instead use {\ttfamily static} methods whenever possible.
