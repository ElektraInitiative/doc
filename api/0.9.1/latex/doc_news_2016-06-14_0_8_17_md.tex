\item author\+: Markus Raab
\item pub\+Date\+: Tue, 14 Jun 2016 08\+:32\+:44 +0200
\item short\+Desc\+: adds several improvements \& survey about configuration
\end{DoxyItemize}

First off\+: We created a survey questionnaire to gather more knowledge about the relevance of configuration systems. If you are involved in the development of free and open source software (F\+L\+O\+SS) you are the person we are looking for.

It would be a great help if you take this survey. It will be available till 18.\+07.\+2016 (anywhere on earth).

For every thoroughly and not anonymously finished survey € 40 cent will be donated to one of the following organizations of your choice\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Lime\+Survey (Lime\+Service, kindly hosts this survey)
\item S\+PI (General Donation\+: 0 A.\+D., Libre\+Office, Debian, Arch\+Linux, …)
\item F\+S\+FE
\item G\+N\+O\+ME
\item K\+DE
\item Mozilla (Firefox)
\item Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The three main points relevant for most people are\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Even though Elektra provides a global keydatabase configuration files stay human read-\/ and writable which allows us to integrate unmodified software.
\item Flexible adoption on how the configuration is accessed via plugins\+: you can run arbitrary code, e.\+g. do a {\ttfamily git commit} or log/notify when configuration files are changed.
\item Elektra allows you to specify configuration values\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item use the value of other configuration values (symbolic links)
\item calculate the values based on other configuration values
\item validation configuration files
\item \href{https://master.libelektra.org/src/tools/pythongen}{\texttt{ generate code based on it}}
\item and much more
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Read more about Why using Elektra, which also contains since this release unique features, further reasons and limitations.

For a small demo see here

\href{https://asciinema.org/a/cantr04assr4jkv8v34uz9b8r}{\texttt{ }}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Qt-\/\+Gui reworked mounting and native icons
\item Full mac\+OS Support, Build Server improvements and new beginner friendly tasks
\item allows us to mount csv, json and xml (and other common provider names) without needing to know plugin names
\item colored output for kdb tools
\item Experimental G\+Settings support
\end{DoxyItemize}

In this release starting developing Elektra gets easier\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} adds run-\/time checks and makes stack traces as if Elektra would not use plugins
\item {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} for plugins got simplified, in most cases it should be not more than calling a single function, even if unit tests and test data are present
\item We prepared \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22}{\texttt{ beginner friendly tasks}} for you.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For details about {\ttfamily E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} and cmake, see individual points below.

There is now a fine collection of external scripts which can executed by {\ttfamily kdb + $<$script$>$}. The new script {\ttfamily kdb find-\/tools} provides full text search over the meta data as provided by the scripts.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily kdb find-\/tools -\/b B\+R\+I\+EF} to search for a short text.
\item {\ttfamily kdb find-\/tools -\/a A\+U\+T\+H\+OR} to search for an author.
\item {\ttfamily kdb find-\/tools -\/d D\+A\+TE} to search for a creation date.
\item {\ttfamily kdb find-\/tools -\/e E\+X\+E\+C\+U\+TE} to search for a type.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Developers should now add Meta\+Data for their scripts..

Thanks to Kurt Micheli!

Because of its P\+O\+S\+IX support one might think it would be trivial to support mac\+OS. Unfortunately there were many small issues, especially in the regular expression handling and the filesystem.

Nevertheless we finally fully support mac\+OS and the newly added travis build server makes sure it will stay this way.

A huge thanks to Manuel Mausz and Mihael Pranjić for fixing the issues and setting up travis\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item jni plugin now can load Elektra (avoids using {\ttfamily .so}) thanks to Mihael Pranjić
\item initial creation of travis.\+yml thanks to Manuel Mausz
\item Add all 3 different X\+Code setups and some mac\+OS fixes thanks to Mihael Pranjić
\end{DoxyItemize}

Now (nearly) every build job can be triggered from Pull Requests. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item jenkins build \href{https://build.libelektra.org/job/libelektra/}{\texttt{ libelektra}} please
\end{DoxyItemize}

For a full list see here.

Thanks to Mihael Pranjić for the setup!


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item fix inconsistency with one excluded compilation variant, thanks to Harald Geyer for reporting \#698
\item fix dynamic searching of installed plugins, needed so that kdb list-\/tools works correctly thanks to Harald Geyer for reporting
\item kdbtimer, {\ttfamily include $<$vector$>$} as needed by some compilers, a big thanks to Andreas Bombe for the non-\/maintainer upload in Debian to fix it for upcoming Debian release
\item also find yajl header files if installed in non-\/standard include directories, thanks to Mihael Pranjić
\item glib\+: make sure we use all definitions returned by pkg-\/config \#719, fixes build on Free\+B\+SD now glib bindings need cmake 2.\+8.\+12 thanks to Mihael Pranjić for reporting/testing and Manuel Mausz for fixing
\item fix I\+NI for mac\+OS (did require some non-\/portable sorting properties of {\ttfamily qsort}.)
\item I\+NI makes I\+N\+I-\/specific meta-\/data private by prefixing {\ttfamily ini}.
\item {\ttfamily kdb export} also works under Min\+GW, thanks to Gabriel Rauter
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item prefer to link shared
\item add plugin tests when using link shared
\item make A\+D\+D\+\_\+\+T\+E\+ST simpler (without calling add\+\_\+plugintest)
\item make installation of test data simpler + honor I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T\+I\+NG option
\item fix installation of test\+\_\+data (do not install whole dir)
\item introduce cache so that it is enough to pass parameters to {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugin$\ast$} once
\item avoid P\+L\+U\+G\+I\+N\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\+E\+C\+T\+O\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME and change C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+C\+U\+R\+R\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+S\+O\+U\+R\+C\+E\+\_\+\+D\+IR and C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+C\+U\+R\+R\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+B\+I\+N\+A\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+D\+IR instead
\item add\+\_\+plugin\+: remove unused option S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+S\+O\+U\+R\+C\+ES
\item implement a 3rd phase to add test cases\+: correctly handles dependencies of test cases to bindings
\item fix testmod\+\_\+jni
\end{DoxyItemize}

for maintainers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The cmake variables K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+B\+\_\+\+S\+Y\+S\+T\+EM and K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+B\+\_\+\+H\+O\+ME are now S\+T\+R\+I\+NG and not P\+A\+TH.
\item B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+F\+U\+LL and B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+T\+IC are now O\+FF by default
\item building with B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+ED is now preferred (for all examples, test cases,...)
\item E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+U\+G\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+LD and E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+B\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+LD is not used anymore.
\item E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG was added\+: it does not add debug symbols but run-\/time assertions.
\item More cmake variables are marked as advanced.
\end{DoxyItemize}

for developers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+T\+IC and B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+F\+U\+LL is now O\+FF by default (nearly) all unit tests now also work with B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+S\+H\+A\+R\+ED
\item to support shared unit tests, a third phase was added when adding plugins inconsistent adding (across phases) of plugins and unit tests is reported
\item in {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugin} remove S\+H\+A\+R\+E\+D\+\_\+\+S\+O\+U\+R\+C\+ES, and add {\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+\_\+\+T\+E\+ST} and {\ttfamily I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+D\+A\+TA}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

and fixes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item adding plugin tests is now much simpler, simply use {\ttfamily A\+D\+D\+\_\+\+T\+E\+ST} in {\ttfamily add\+\_\+plugin}.
\item K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+B\+\_\+\+S\+Y\+S\+T\+EM and K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+B\+\_\+\+H\+O\+ME are now S\+T\+R\+I\+NG and not P\+A\+TH because of incorrect resolving of {\ttfamily $\sim$}.
\item lua bindings tests\+: make sure lua executable matches with the lua libraries version thanks to Mihael Pranjić
\item lua bindings\+: do not use hard-\/coded {\ttfamily lua} executable.
\item Fix cmake configure when B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+D\+O\+C\+U\+M\+E\+N\+T\+A\+T\+I\+ON is set to O\+FF thanks to Kurt Micheli
\end{DoxyItemize}

As part of the ongoing work of the bachelor thesis {\ttfamily Integration of Elektra into the G\+N\+O\+ME desktop environment} we now have experimental support for Elektra as a G\+Settings backend on Linux (We will look into getting mac\+OS support on a later date). When installed, applications using G\+Settings default backend will write to Elektra below the {\ttfamily /sw} key. The G\+Settings bindings are intended as a preview version so please do not use them in a production system.

To build the G\+Settings backend you have to explicitly add the binding even if {\ttfamily A\+LL} is given. e.\+g. {\ttfamily -\/D\+B\+I\+N\+D\+I\+N\+GS=gsettings} {\ttfamily -\/D\+B\+I\+N\+D\+I\+N\+GS=\char`\"{}\+A\+L\+L;gsettings\char`\"{}}

All needed core functionality of a G\+Settings backend is already implemented. This includes notification support if you have your {\ttfamily /sw} mounted with the dbus plugin.

Please report any bugs you encounter.

For further information regarding the status of the implementations please refer to the corresponding \href{https://github.com/elektrainitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/bindings/gsettings}{\texttt{ R\+E\+A\+D\+ME}} and \href{https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/775}{\texttt{ ticket}}.

Mounting now supports to mount commonly known names even if the name is not a plugin. If more than one plugin is available automatically the best one is selected. The selection process works by annotating different qualities of the plugins, see {\ttfamily infos/status} in the R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md of individual plugins.

E.\+g. to mount a file using a json plugin (called yajl because of the library\textquotesingle{}s name it build upon)


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb mount file.json json}
\end{DoxyCode}


stores filtered keys internally so that they do not get accidentally lost and can be written to the storage again without the user having to remember including them in the writeout

The longer term goal is to add such global plugins per default, so that the usage of the A\+PI is easier.

For now you can simply add it using\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb global-mount cachefilter}
\end{DoxyCode}


Thanks to Marvin Mall.

The Qt G\+UI receives new features and a better gnome integration. Its version number was updated to 0.\+0.\+12 (beta). Major features\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item use native icons (Qt G\+UI xdg icon theme support rework) thanks to Gabriel Rauter
\item update desktop entry org.\+libelektra.\+elektra-\/qt-\/editor.\+desktop with new symbolic icon of Elektra’s logo so that qt-\/gui can nicely started from within Gnome thanks to Gabriel Rauter
\item Add new layout elements to backend wizard and integrate new Backend\+Builder functionality (See Common Provider Names) to qt-\/gui thanks to Raffael Pancheri
\end{DoxyItemize}

Bug fixes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reset to defaults now reverts back to build-\/in defaults.
\item Make clicks on search icon focus on search textfield.
\item save settings when settings dialog is closed.
\item fix crash of qt-\/gui when crypto plugin was enabled (and added /shutdown option to enable previous behaviour) thanks to Peter Nirschl
\item fix qt-\/gui fails to synchronize because of readonly plugins thanks to Raffael Pancheri
\item Rename desktop file\+: correct reverse url from org.\+elektra to org.\+libelektra.
\item Rename elektra-\/qt to elektra-\/qt-\/editor.
\item Rename Choose\+Color\+Window\+: The Choose\+Color\+Windows will be replaced by a Appearance\+Settings\+Window, all references to Choose\+Color, choose color have been replaced by Appearance\+Settings or choose appearance.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Other improvements\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install {\ttfamily elektra-\/qt-\/editor} binary so both the desktop files Try\+Exec works and people not starting the gui trough {\ttfamily kdb qt-\/gui} have a speaking name in their process list.
\item Replace occurences of {\ttfamily Elektra Editor} with {\ttfamily Elektra Qt Editor} so that we use the same name in all places apart from the tools binary.
\item Introduce Appearance Settings Window\+: Appearance Settings Window contains both color settings as well as a switch to disable or enable the system icon theme. For this to work we had to introduce the setting in {\ttfamily guisettings}. We also added a private function in {\ttfamily guisettings} to get and set settings with a boolean value.
\item Tree reload on Settings close\+: We now synch and refresh the tree view on closing of the settings window if any settings have been changed, so changes can be seen imediatly in the tree.
\item Add qt5 svg module as dependency\+: the qt5 svg module is needed so we can display icon themes that provide svg as icon format.
\item Add and install symbolic icon with the installation of the Elektra Qt Editor.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Thanks to Gabriel Rauter and Raffael Pancheri for the engagement in improving qt-\/gui.

A big thanks to Gabriel Rauter for improving the user experience with the kdb tool. On errors and in {\ttfamily kdb info} it was often quite hard to find the relevant text.

Now important parts are highlighted by bold or colorful text. This helps to spot the important information immediately without sacrificing information that would be important for a detailed analysis.

Every tool now has the option {\ttfamily -\/-\/color} and {\ttfamily -\/C} which is set to {\ttfamily auto} per default. By writing to\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb set user/sw/elektra/kdb/\#0/color off}
\end{DoxyCode}


one can go back to previous behavior.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item improve documentation about how to pop a key
\item document how to avoid running test cases as root in T\+E\+S\+T\+I\+NG.md.
\item document guarantees of {\ttfamily elektra\+Plugin\+Get\+Data}, thanks to Marvin Mall
\item doc mentions that -\/1 should be returned {\itshape always} when an error is set
\item many more spelling mistakes were fixed and useless whitespace was removed, thanks to René Schwaiger
\item describe preferences when plugins are included/excluded
\item improvements in {\ttfamily ks\+Copy}, {\ttfamily ks\+Pop}, {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} and {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} \href{https://doc.libelektra.org/api/0.8.17/html/}{\texttt{ A\+PI description}}
\item added W\+HY document
\item updated plugin decision to include 3rd phase
\end{DoxyItemize}

E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG now enables a debug build for Elektra. It has nothing to do with debug symbols, but\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item it enables assertions
\item it enables \href{http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html}{\texttt{ undefinied behavior sanitizer}} for clang
\item plugins will not be closed so that stack traces are more useful (using {\ttfamily R\+T\+L\+D\+\_\+\+N\+O\+D\+E\+L\+E\+TE})
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} is recommended for every developer, even if you are not modifying Elektra itself. The assertions will give you hints on A\+PI misusage.

For example, {\ttfamily key\+New} was known to be error-\/prone. {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} now will report wrong parameters by an assertion.

The old options {\ttfamily E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} and {\ttfamily E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+B\+O\+SE} are not available anymore.

Thanks to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Thomas Waser for pointing to {\ttfamily R\+T\+L\+D\+\_\+\+N\+O\+D\+E\+L\+E\+TE}
\item Gabriel Rauter for fixing qt-\/gui with {\ttfamily -\/D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG=ON}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The constants plugin was updated to provide {\ttfamily cmake/\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+L\+O\+G\+G\+ER} {\ttfamily cmake/\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG} and will no longer provide {\ttfamily cmake/\+E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+U\+G\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+LD} {\ttfamily cmake/\+E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+B\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+LD}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Gabriel Rauter is now listed in A\+U\+T\+H\+O\+RS.md
\item constants plugin\+: configure\+\_\+file now uses current binary directory, not cluttering the main build directory.
\item fix ssize\+\_\+t for V\+S2015, thanks to Gabriel Rauter
\item gtest\+: fix linking when using arch systemd-\/nspawn, thanks to Marvin Mall
\item {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH} is added to lua and python bindings needed for mac\+OS, thanks to Mihael Pranjić
\item Fix external unit test for Ubuntu 15.\+04 by putting files before the flags, thanks to Marvin Mall
\item symbols in {\ttfamily Ni\+\_\+} namespace are now in {\ttfamily elektra\+Ni\+\_\+}
\item add more ipv4 and ipv6 test cases for IP adress validation checker
\item crypto-\/plugin avoid usage of hardcoded error numbers, thanks to Peter Nirschl
\item do not use number for resolver position
\item to fix a compiler warning in mac\+OS, we made the printf format specifier of time\+\_\+t more portable, thanks to René Schwaiger
\item many preparations for global plugins and mmap
\item in the constants plugin {\ttfamily cmake/\+B\+U\+I\+L\+T\+I\+N\+\_\+\+P\+L\+U\+G\+I\+N\+\_\+\+F\+O\+L\+D\+ER}, {\ttfamily B\+U\+I\+L\+T\+I\+N\+\_\+\+D\+A\+T\+A\+\_\+\+F\+O\+L\+D\+ER} and {\ttfamily B\+U\+I\+L\+T\+I\+N\+\_\+\+E\+X\+E\+C\+\_\+\+F\+O\+L\+D\+ER} were added.
\item doxygen is only run once during build, thanks to René Schwaiger
\item add script configure-\/home to build Elektra that it will resolve all pathes to home-\/directories
\item add script metaini-\/to-\/c that converts M\+E\+T\+A\+D\+A\+T\+A.\+ini to C-\/code, thanks to Thomas Waser
\item add note that default values must be present for code generation, thanks to Martin Schleiss
\item avoid {\ttfamily seq} as it is not available in some {\ttfamily $\ast$\+B\+SD}, thanks to Mihael Pranjić
\item make jni testmod check consistent to others
\end{DoxyItemize}

As always, the A\+BI and A\+PI is fully forward-\/ and backward-\/compatible, i.\+e. programs compiled against an older 0.\+8 version of Elektra will continue to work (A\+BI) and you will be able to recompile every program without errors (A\+PI). This time you can even compile programs against 0.\+8.\+17 and run with 0.\+8.\+16.

For the qt-\/gui the svg module is added as dependency.

New and missing files in the installation\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily elektra-\/qt-\/editor} is installed in the path (needed for Try\+Exec in Desktop file)
\item {\ttfamily libelektrasettings.\+so} will be installed if {\ttfamily gsettings} binding is enabled
\item {\ttfamily libelektra-\/cachefilter.\+so} is the new cachefilter plugin
