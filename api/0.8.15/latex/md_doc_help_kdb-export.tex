\subsection*{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N}

This command allows a user to export keys from the key database. Keys are exported to {\ttfamily stdout} in whichever format is specified. This command can also be used to view full key(s) including their values.

\subsection*{U\+S\+A\+G\+E}

Where {\ttfamily source} is the path of the key(s) you want to export. Additionally, the user can specify a format to use by passing it as the option argument {\ttfamily format}. The {\ttfamily format} attribute relies on Elektra's plugin system to export the keys in the desired format. The user can view all plugins available for use by running the kdb-\/list(1) command. To learn about any plugin, the user can simply use the kdb-\/info(1) command.
