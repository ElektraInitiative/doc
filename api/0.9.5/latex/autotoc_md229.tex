The filecheck plugin validates files. It tests\+: encoding, lineendings, B\+OM, printable characters and null bytes.

{\ttfamily check/lineending} {\ttfamily valid/lineending} When the {\ttfamily check/lineending} key is present, the plugin checks the file for consistent line endings. If you want to validate for a specific line ending you can supply it with the {\ttfamily valid/lineending} key. Valid values are\+: {\ttfamily CR}, {\ttfamily LF}, {\ttfamily C\+R\+LF}, {\ttfamily L\+F\+CR}.

{\ttfamily check/encoding} {\ttfamily valid/encoding} When the {\ttfamily check\+Encoding} key is present, the plugin validates the file encoding supplied by the key {\ttfamily encoding}, or, if not present, defaults to {\ttfamily U\+T\+F-\/8}

{\ttfamily reject/null} When the {\ttfamily reject/null} key is present, the plugin rejects the file if a N\+U\+L\+L-\/\+Byte is found.

{\ttfamily reject/bom} When the {\ttfamily reject/bom} key is present, the plugin rejects the file if any B\+OM markers are found.

{\ttfamily reject/unprintable} When the {\ttfamily reject/unprintable} key is preset, the plugin rejects the file if an unprintable character is present (except {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}r} and {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}n}).
