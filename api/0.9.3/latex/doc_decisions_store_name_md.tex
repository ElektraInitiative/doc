Memory Consumption in Elektra is quite high as the key names are long and stored twice in memory.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item comparing of keys and thus searching in key sets must be possible with memcmp
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item printing the escaped key name is not so much used
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item store both
\end{DoxyItemize}

Only store one key name, suitable for comparing/searching/iterating over name.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item saves memory
\item reduces A\+PI ({\ttfamily key\+Unescaped\+Name$\ast$})
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item rename {\ttfamily key\+Unescaped\+Name} to {\ttfamily key\+Name}
\item To get the key\+Name you then would need something like `elektra\+Encode\+Key\+Name(buffer, key\+Name(...
\end{DoxyItemize}
