{\ttfamily kdb backup}

This command will backup the {\ttfamily system}, {\ttfamily user} and {\ttfamily spec} configuration. Afterwards a timestamp, which can be used to restore everything, will be printed.

The backup will be done in the {\ttfamily /var/tmp} directory, so make sure the backup is not deleted.
