Applications want to ensure that some functionality (=global plugin) is present in Elektra.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Keep {\ttfamily kdb\+Ensure} (Rejected because it is too flexible and can be called many times. Furthermore, {\ttfamily kdb\+Open} would build up configurations that get removed afterwards.)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item reduce for only global plugins, as the partial other functionality is confusing and not needed
\item find solution that list plugin is not needed
\item only as implementation detail below libraries (e.\+g. like done for notification)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Specific A\+P\+Is per plugin, Rejected because\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item difficult for application developers
\item every plugin would need to design new A\+P\+Is
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Have a new A\+PI\+: {\ttfamily K\+DB $\ast$ kdb\+Open (Key $\ast$ parent);} {\ttfamily int kdb\+Configure (K\+DB $\ast$ handle, Key\+Set $\ast$ contract, Key $\ast$ parent\+Key);} {\ttfamily K\+DB $\ast$ kdb\+Open\+Default (Key $\ast$ parent);} The new kdb\+Open only does the absolute minimum work, in particular it doesn\textquotesingle{}t set up any global plugins. If you use kdb\+Open you must call kdb\+Configure otherwise kdb\+Get will fail. kdb\+Configure configures global plugins (basically just a renamed kdb\+Ensure). Lastly, kdb\+Open\+Default does more or less what the old kdb\+Open does. It sets up the default case and you can call kdb\+Get immediately. But you cannot call kdb\+Configure after kdb\+Open\+Default. Rejected because of A\+PI bloat and introduction of further state in {\ttfamily kdb}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Integrate {\ttfamily kdb\+Ensure} in {\ttfamily kdb\+Open(\+Key $\ast$error\+Key, Key\+Set $\ast$contract)} but only allow global plugins.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item can immediately build up correct plugin positioning
\item does not allow to start applications if the contract cannot be fulfilled
\item simplest and minimalistic solution
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily elektra\+Notification\+Open} will only return a contract Key\+Set\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
KeySet * contract = \hyperlink{group__keyset_ga671e1aaee3ae9dc13b4834a4ddbd2c3c}{ksNew} (0, \hyperlink{group__keyset_ga7a28fce3773b2c873c94ac80b8b4cd54}{KS\_END});
elektraNotificationContract (contract, iobinding);
\end{DoxyCode}


The same for gopts\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
elektraGOptsContract (contract, argc, argv, environ);
\end{DoxyCode}


Finally, we create {\ttfamily K\+DB} with the contracts we got before\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
KDB * kdb = \hyperlink{group__kdb_ga6808defe5870f328dd17910aacbdc6ca}{kdbOpen} (key, contract);
\end{DoxyCode}


Opening {\ttfamily K\+DB} will fail if any of the contracts cannot be ensured.

As the {\ttfamily contract} gets copied, at any point after {\ttfamily kdb\+Open} the contract can be safely deleted\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
ksDel (contract);
\end{DoxyCode}


The cleanup of the global plugins happens within\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\hyperlink{group__kdb_gadb54dc9fda17ee07deb9444df745c96f}{kdbClose} (kdb, errorKey);
\end{DoxyCode}


It is safe to use the contract {\ttfamily Key\+Set} also for {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} and {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} invocations.
