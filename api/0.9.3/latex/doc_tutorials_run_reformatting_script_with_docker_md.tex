Running the reformat-\/all script requires multiple dependencies. To overcome this problem, instead of trying to install all the necessary dependencies on your own, you can easily build a Docker image and run the script inside a Docker container based on this image.

Do you want to run the reformat-\/all script easily and without any hassle? You\textquotesingle{}ve come to the right place.

This is a step-\/by-\/step guide. Just follow the steps and you are good to go!


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Docker for Linux containers has to be preinstalled. Please refer to \href{https://docs.docker.com/install/}{\tt https\+://docs.\+docker.\+com/install/} if you haven\textquotesingle{}t installed it yet. Your host OS should better be Linux, because we are going to use your current Linux user ID for building the image.
\item Basic knowledge of Docker (not mandatory)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Now you are going to build your own Docker image based on Debian.

From the source root directory run the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
docker build -t buildelektra-sid \(\backslash\)
        --build-arg JENKINS\_USERID=$(id -u) \(\backslash\)
        --build-arg JENKINS\_GROUPID=$(id -g) \(\backslash\)
        -f scripts/docker/debian/sid/Dockerfile \(\backslash\)
        scripts/docker/debian/sid/
\end{DoxyCode}


The build process depends on your Internet connection speed and the overall performance of your hardware. Most likely, it will take at least 5 minutes. Please be patient. Once you have built the image, you can reuse it multiple times.

The image tag {\ttfamily buildelektra-\/sid} we suggested can be replaced by a name of your own choosing. Note that currently our {\ttfamily sid} image is the only one with all the necessary tools installed.

After you built the image, you can execute a container like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
docker run -it --rm \(\backslash\)
        -v "$PWD:/home/jenkins/workspace" \(\backslash\)
        -w /home/jenkins/workspace \(\backslash\)
        buildelektra-sid
\end{DoxyCode}


Again, if you changed the image tag {\ttfamily buildelektra-\/sid}, please change it above as well.

After starting the container, you should be automatically inside it in the working directory {\ttfamily /home/jenkins/workspace}.

Now run the script\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
scripts/dev/reformat-all
\end{DoxyCode}


All your files should be reformatted afterwards.
