shortDesc: adds specification namespace & numerous improvements
.PP
.PP
From the beginning of the Elektra Initiative, Elektra aimed at avoiding hard coded information in the application and to make the application's configuration more transparent\&. While avoiding any paths to files was reality from the first released Elektra version, now also hard coding default values, fallback mechanisms and even Elektraâ€™s paths to keys can be avoided\&.
.PP
.SS "How does that work?"
.PP
Elektra 0\&.8\&.11 introduces a so called specification for the application's configuration\&. It is located below its own namespace \fCspec\fP (next to user and system)\&.
.PP
Once the base path is known, the user can find out all Elektra paths used by an application, using: 
.PP
.nf
kdb ls spec/basepath

.fi
.PP
.PP
Keys in \fCspec\fP allow us to specify which keys are read by the application, which fallback it might have and which is the default value using metadata\&. The implementation of these features happened in \fCksLookup\fP\&. When cascading keys (those starting with \fC/\fP) are used following features are now available (in the metadata of respective \fCspec\fP-keys):
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCoverride/#\fP: use these keys \fIin favour\fP of the key itself (note that \fC#\fP is the syntax for arrays, e\&.g\&. \fC#0\fP for the first element, \fC#_10\fP for the 11th and so on)
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCnamespace/#\fP: instead of using all namespaces in the predefined order, one can specify which namespaces should be searched in which order
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCfallback/#\fP: when no key was found in any of the (specified) namespaces the \fCfallback\fP-keys will be searched
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCdefault\fP: this value will be used if nothing else was found
.PP
.PP
This technique does not only give you the obvious advantages, but also provides complete transparency how a program will fetch a configuration value\&. In practice that means that: 
.PP
.nf
kdb get "/sw/app/#0/promise"

.fi
.PP
.PP
will give you the \fIexact same value\fP as the application uses when it lookups the key \fCpromise\fP\&. Many \fCif\fPs and hard coded values are avoided, we simply fetch and lookup the configuration by following code: 
.PP
.nf
Key *parentKey = keyNew("/sw/app/#0", KEY_CASCADING_NAME, KEY_END);
kdbGet(kdb, ks, parentKey);

ksLookupByName(ks, "/sw/app/#0/promise", 0);

.fi
.PP
.PP
We see in that example that only Elektra paths are hard coded in the application\&. But those can be found out easily, completely without looking in the source code\&. The technique is simple: append a logger plugin and the KDB base path is printed to:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
stdout in the case of the plugin tracer
.IP "\(bu" 2
syslog in the case of the plugin syslog
.IP "\(bu" 2
journald in the case of the plugin journald
.PP
.PP
What we do not see in the program above are the default values and fallbacks\&. They are only present in the so specification (namespace \fCspec\fP)\&. Luckily, the specification are key-value pairs, too\&. So we do not have to learn something new, e\&.g\&. using the ni plugin we can specify: 
.PP
.nf
[promise]
default=20
fallback/#0=/somewhere/else
namespace/#0=user

.fi
.PP
.PP
1\&.) When this file is mounted to \fCspec/sw/app/#0\fP we specify, that for the key \fC/sw/app/#0/promise\fP only the namespace \fCuser\fP should be used\&. 2\&.) If this key was not found, but \fC/somewhere/else\fP is present, we will use this key instead\&. The \fCfallback\fP technique is very powerful: it allows us to have (recursive) links between applications\&. In the example above, the application is tricked in receiving e\&.g\&. the key \fCuser/somewhere/else\fP when \fCpromise\fP was not available\&. 3\&.) The value \fC20\fP will be used as default, even if no configuration file is found\&.
.PP
Note that the fallback, override and cascading works on \fIkey level\fP, and not like most other systems have implemented, on configuration \fIfile level\fP\&.
.PP
.SS "Namespaces"
.PP
The specification gives the namespaces clearer semantics and purpose\&. Key names starting with a namespace are connected to a configuration source\&. E\&.g\&. keys starting with:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCuser\fP are keys from the home directory of the current user
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCsystem\fP are keys from the \fC/etc\fP directory of the current system
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCspec\fP are keys from the specification directory (configurable with KDB_DB_SPEC, typically \fC/usr/share/elektra/specification\fP)
.PP
.PP
When a key name starts with an \fC/\fP it means that it is looked up by specification\&. Such a cascading key is not really present in the keyset (except when a default value was found)\&. They are neither received nor stored by \fCkdbGet\fP and \fCkdbSet\fP\&.
.PP
Applications shall only lookup using cascading keys (starting with \fC/\fP)\&. If no specification is present, cascading of all namespaces is used as before\&.
.PP
Elektra will (always) continue to work for applications that do not have a specification\&. We strongly encourage you, however, to write such a specification, because:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
it helps the administrator to know which keys exist
.IP "\(bu" 2
it documents the keys (including lookup behaviour and default value)
.IP "\(bu" 2
and many more advantages to come in future releases\&.\&.

.SS "Simplification in the merging framework"
.PP
As it turned out the concept of very granular merge strategies was hard to understand for users of the three-way merging framework that emerged in the last year's GSoC\&. While this granularity is desirable for flexibility, we additionally wanted something easy to use\&. For that reason merge configurations were introduced\&. These are simply preconfigured configurations for a merger that arrange required strategies for the most common merging scenarios\&. Especially they make sure that meta merging is handled correctly\&.
.PP
Have a look at the changes in the example \fC/src/libs/tools/examples/merging\&.cpp\fP for an glimpse of the simplifications\&.
.PP
A big thanks to Felix Berlakovich!
.PP
The header files will be installed to /usr/include/elektra/merging, but they are subject to be changed in the future (e\&.g\&. as they did in this release)\&.
.PP
From the merging improvements some minor incompatibility happened in \fCkdb import\fP\&. Not all merging strategies that worked in 0\&.8\&.10 work anymore\&. Luckily, now its much simpler to choose the strategies\&.
.PP
.SS "API"
.PP
The main API kdb\&.h has two added lines\&. First a new method was added: 
.PP
.nf
ssize_t keyAddName(Key *key, const char *addName);

.fi
.PP
.PP
This method is already used heavily in many parts\&. Contrary to \fCkeySetBaseName\fP and \fCkeyAddBaseName\fP it allows us to extend the path with more than one Element at once, i\&.e\&. \fC/\fP are not escaped\&.
.PP
The other new line is the new enum value \fCKEY_FLAGS\fP\&. This feature allows bindings to use any flags in keyNew without actually building up variable argument lists\&. (Thanks to Manuel Mausz)
.PP
As always, API+ABI is stable and compatible\&.
.PP
.SS "Proposed"
.PP
Many new functions are proposed and can be found in \fCthe doxygen docu\fP and in \fCkdbproposal\&.h\fP\&.
.PP
Noteworthy is the method \fCkeyGetNamespace\fP which allows us to query all namespaces\&. Since this release we changed every occurrence of namespaces (except documentation) with switch-statements around \fCkeyGetNamespace\fP\&. This allows us to add new more namespaces more easily\&. (Although its currently not planned to add further namespaces\&.)
.PP
Finally, a bunch of new lookup options were added, which might not be useful for the public API (they allow us to disable the specification-aware features mentioned in the beginning)\&.
.PP
.SS "Obsolete and removed concepts"
.PP
.SS "umount"
.PP
The concept that backends have a name (other than their mountpoint) is now gone\&. Backends will simply be named with their escaped mountpath below system/elektra/mountpoints without any confusing additional name\&.
.PP
Unmounting still works with the mountpath\&.
.PP
Removing this concept makes Elektra easier to understand and it also removes some bugs\&. E\&.g\&. having mountpoints which do not differ except having a \fC_\fP instead of a \fC/\fP would have caused problems with the automatic name generation of Elektra 0\&.8\&.10\&.
.PP
Old mountpoints need to be removed with their 0\&.8\&.10 name (\fC_\fP instead of \fC/\fP)\&.
.PP
.SS "directory keys"
.PP
Additionally, the so called directory keys were also removed\&. Elektra was and still is completely key-value based\&. The \fC/\fP separator is only used for mountpoints\&.
.PP
.SS "fstab"
.PP
The plugin fstab is also improved: Slashes in mountpoints are escaped properly with the internal escaping engine of \fBkeyAddBaseName()\fP (i\&.e\&. without any problematic \fC/\fP replacements)\&.
.PP
.SS "dirname"
.PP
getDirName() was removed from C++, gi-lua, gi-python2, gi-python3, swig-lua, swig-python2 and swig-python3\&. It was never present in C and did not fit well with \fBkeyBaseName()\fP (which returns an unescaped name, which is not possible for the dirname)\&. (Thanks to Manuel Mausz)
.PP
.SS "invalid parent names"
.PP
While empty (=invalid) names are still accepted as parentName to \fCkdbGet\fP and \fCkdbSet\fP for compatibility reasons, but the parentKey 
.PP
.nf
Key *parentKey = keyNew("/", KEY_END);

.fi
.PP
.PP
should be used instead (if you want to get or store everything)\&. They have identical behaviour, except that invalid names (that cannot be distinguished from empty names) will produce a warning\&. In the next major version invalid parentNames will produce an error\&.
.PP
.SS "KDB Behaviour"
.PP
It is now enforced that before a \fBkdbSet()\fP on a specific path a \fBkdbGet()\fP on that path needs to be done\&. This was always documented that way and is the only way to correctly detect conflicts, updates and missing configuration files\&. Error #107 will be reported on violations\&.
.PP
Additionally, the handling with missing files was improved\&. Empty keysets for a mountpoint now will remove a file\&. Such an empty file is always up-to-date\&. Removing files has the same atomicity guarantees as other operations\&.
.PP
The concurrency behaviour is at a very high level: as expected many processes with many threads can each concurrently write to the key database, without any inconsistent states: This is noted here because Elektra works on standard configuration files without any guarding processes\&.
.PP
Filesystem problems, e\&.g\&. permission, now always lead to the same errors (#9, #75, #109, #110), regardless of the storage plugin\&.
.PP
