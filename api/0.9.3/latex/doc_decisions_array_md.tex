Currently it is inefficient to detect the length of an array and it is impossible to know if a key (without subkeys) should be an array or not.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item None
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Meta-\/data arrays simply work by convention as they are not serialized in special ways nor they get validated.
\item {\ttfamily \#\#\#empty\+\_\+array} as in {\ttfamily yajl}, problem\+: does not allow efficient access of first element
\item store length (and not last element), problem\+: needs prepending of {\ttfamily \#\+\_\+...}
\item store element after last element (C++-\/\+Style), would not fit nicely with key-\/value
\item use value and not the metadata {\ttfamily array}, problem\+: is ambiguous
\item use metadata on all children
\end{DoxyItemize}

Store length in metadata {\ttfamily array} of key, or keep metadata {\ttfamily array} empty if empty array. For example ({\ttfamily ni syntax}, sections used for metadata)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
myarray/#0 = value0
myarray/#1 = value1
myarray/#2 = value2
myarray/#3 = value3
myarray/#4 = value4
myarray/#5 = value5
[myarray]
  array = #5
\end{DoxyCode}


It is not allowed to have anything else than {\ttfamily \#5} in the metadata {\ttfamily array}, e.\+g. even {\ttfamily \#4} would be a malformed array.

The metadata {\ttfamily array} preferable should be in {\ttfamily spec} (specified configuration). Then the {\ttfamily spec} plugin will add the {\ttfamily array} marker with the correct length. This needs to be happen early, so that plugins can rely on having correct arrays.

For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
spec:/myarray      # <- has array marker

user:/myarray      # <- either has correct array marker or no array marker
user:/myarray/#0
user:/myarray/#1
\end{DoxyCode}


Here, the {\ttfamily spec} plugin would add {\ttfamily array=\#1} to {\ttfamily user\+:/myarray} if it was not there before.

To lookup an array, first do {\ttfamily ks\+Lookup\+By\+Name (ks, \char`\"{}/myarray\char`\"{}, 0)} on the parent. With the last index you get from its metadata {\ttfamily array}, iterate over the children. A cascading lookup on every individual child is also needed to make sure that overrides on individual elements are respected.

For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
spec:/myarray    # <- contains the specification for the array
spec:/myarray/#  # <- contains the specification for the array elements

dir:/myarray/#0  # <- not an array, just an override for user:/myarray/#

user:/myarray    # <- with metadata array=#0, this would be the array we get
user:/myarray/#0

system:/myarray  # <- not found in cascading lookup, as user:/myarray exists
\end{DoxyCode}


Guarantees we want from the spec plugin\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item that the parent key always contain {\ttfamily array}.
\item that the correct length is in {\ttfamily array}
\item that the array only contains {\ttfamily \#} children
\item that the children are numbered from 0 to n, without holes
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Is very similar to {\ttfamily binary} metadata.
\item The key alone suffices to know if its an array
\item One can distinguish an array with keys that are called by chance e.\+g. {\ttfamily \#0}
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item yajl needs to be fixed
\item metadata library needs to be adapted
\item spec plugin needs to be fixed, a lot of work needed there. Most amount of work is to detect misstructured nested arrays ({\ttfamily \#} intermixed with non {\ttfamily \#} keys) which is a possibility also in all the alternatives of this decision.
\item A {\ttfamily user\+:/} or {\ttfamily dir\+:/} key can change the semantics of a {\ttfamily system\+:/} array, if not avoided by {\ttfamily spec}.
