\end{DoxyParagraph}
\hyperlink{kdbnotification_8h_aeae96154abdb5fdbf1b34a01e2b23e44}{elektra\+Notification\+Open()} loads and mounts the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/internalnotification}{\tt internalnotification plugin} globally at run-\/time. The key database is not altered permanently. \hyperlink{kdbnotification_8h_a5685dafbd4131011365628d6d9213594}{elektra\+Notification\+Close()} reverts the mounting.

The internalnotification plugin is mounted at its defined positions (see \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/internalnotification}{\tt its plugin docs}).


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If no plugin is mounted at a desired position it is simply mounted.
\item In the default configuration or when mounting a plugin globally using {\ttfamily kdb global-\/mount} the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/list}{\tt list plugin} is mounted at all positions. This plugin allows to mount multiple plugins at a position. If this plugin is present at a position the internalnotification plugin is added to the list plugin\textquotesingle{}s configuration at run-\/time.
\item If another plugin is mounted at a desired position the configuration is considered broken and mounting is aborted. The list plugin requires to be mounted at all positions in order to keep track of the current position and call plugins accordingly.
