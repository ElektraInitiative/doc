.PP
.SH "Introduction"
.PP
This plugin allows applications to access command-line options and environment variables via the KDB\&.
.PP
It is implemented as a simple frontend for the parser implemented in the internal \fCelektraGetOpts\fP\&.
.PP
For more information on how to write the necessary specification and on using command-line options in general, take a look at \fBthe dedicated tutorial\fP
.PP
Depending on the calling context and configuration, this plugin might use operating system specific functions to determine command-line arguments and environment variables\&. Which operating system's functions the plugin uses is determined at compile-time\&.
.PP
.RS 4
\fBNote:\fP One of the system-specific implementations of this plugin relies on procfs\&. Therefore, if you compile the plugin on a system with procfs, the plugin may not work on other machine with the same OS or even on the same machine, if procfs is not mounted\&. 
.RE
.PP
.SH "Installation"
.PP
See \fBinstallation\fP\&. The package is called \fClibelektra5-experimental\fP\&.
.SH "Basic Usage"
.PP
The preferred way of using this plugin is via a \fCkdbOpen\fP contract:
.PP
.PP
.nf
KeySet * contract = ksNew (0, KS_END);
elektraGOptsContract (contract, argc, argv, environ, parentKey, NULL);

KDB * kdb = kdbOpen (contract, parentKey);

// gopts automatically mounted
KeySet * ks = ksNew (0, KS_END);
kdbGet (kdb, ks, parentKey);
.fi
.PP
.SH "Configuration Keys"
.PP
The plugin accepts a number of configuration keys\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC/offset\fP: You can set this key to an integer \fCn\fP\&. The plugin will then ignore the first \fCn\fP command-line arguments and only pass the rest on to the parser\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC/help/usage\fP: The value of this key is used to replace the standard usage line in the auto-generated help message\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC/help/prefix\fP: The value of this key is inserted between the usage line and the options list in the auto-generated help message\&.
.PP
.SH "Global KeySet"
.PP
The plugin also takes part of its configuration from the global KeySet\&. All keys the plugin uses are below \fCsystem:/elektra/gopts\fP\&. This prefix is abbreviated to \fC//\fP below\&.
.PP
This plugin may use the following keys from the global KeySet:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC//parent\fP: If present, the plugin will use this key instead of the one provided by \fCkdbGet\fP as the parent key pass on to the parser\&. Specifically, the plugin uses this keys value as the key name for a new key that is passed to the parser\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC//argc\fP: If present and \fC//parent\fP is present as well, the plugin expects \fC//argv\fP to be present as well\&. This key must be binary and its value must be an \fCint\fP\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC//argv\fP: If present and \fC//parent\fP is present as well, the plugin expects \fC//argc\fP to be present as well\&. The values of \fC//argc\fP and \fC//argv\fP will be used instead of using the OS specific implementation\&. This key must be binary and its value must be a \fCconst char * const *\fP\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC//envp\fP: If present and \fC//parent\fP is present as well, the value of this key will be used as the list of environment variables\&. This key must be binary and its value must be a \fCconst char * const *\fP\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC//args\fP: If present and \fC//parent\fP is present as well, but \fC//argc\fP and \fC//argv\fP are absent, this will be used as the list of command-line arguments\&. This key must be binary and its value must be a zero-byte separated (and terminated) list of strings\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC//env\fP: If present and \fC//parent\fP is present as well, but \fC//envp\fP is absent, this will be used as the list of environment variable\&. This key must be binary and its value must be a zero-byte separated (and terminated) list of strings\&.
