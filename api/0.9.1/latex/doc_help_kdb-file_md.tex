{\ttfamily kdb file $<$key name$>$}~\newline


Where {\ttfamily key name} is the name of the key to check.~\newline


This command prints which file a given key is stored in.~\newline
 While many keys are stored in a default key database file, many others are stored in any number of configuration files located all over the system.~\newline
 This tool is made to allow users to find out the file that a key is actually stored in.~\newline
 This command makes use of Elektraâ€™s {\ttfamily resolver} plugin which the uer can learn more about by running the command {\ttfamily kdb plugin-\/info resolver}.
