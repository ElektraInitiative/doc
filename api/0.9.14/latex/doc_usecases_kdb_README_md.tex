 This folder contains the use cases for the Key Database (KDB). These primarily are the basis for {\ttfamily libelektra-\/kdb}, but may also influence other things like, e.\+g., the high-\/level API {\ttfamily libelektra-\/highlevel}.

The KDB is primarily a system for storing application configuration data. The individual use cases provide details for this high-\/level use case.
