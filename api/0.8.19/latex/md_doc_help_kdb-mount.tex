\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Where {\ttfamily path} is the path to the file the user wants to mount. See {\ttfamily kdb info resolver} for details what an absolute and relative path means. See also I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+N\+T below.
\item {\ttfamily mountpoint} is where in the key database the new backend should be mounted. For a cascading mountpoint, {\ttfamily mountpoint} should start with {\ttfamily /}. See also I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+N\+T below.
\item A list of such plugins with a configuration for each of them can be given\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily plugin} should be an Elektra plugin.
\item Plugins may be followed by a {\ttfamily ,} separated list of {\ttfamily keys=values} pairs which will be used as plugin configuration.

This command allows a user to mount a new {\itshape backend}. The idea of mounting is explained \hyperlink{md_doc_help_elektra-mounting_doc_help_elektra-mounting_md}{in elektra-\/mounting(7)}.

Mounting in Elektra allows the user to mount a file into the current key database like a user may mount a partition into the current filesystem. This functionality is key to Elektra as it allows users to build a global key database comprised of many different configuration files. A backend acts as a worker to allow Elektra to interpret configuration files as keys in the central key database such that any edits to the keys are reflected in the file and vice versa. Additionally, the user can use this command to list the currently mounted backends by running the command with no arguments.

\subsection*{I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+N\+T}

This command writes into the {\ttfamily /etc} directory and as such it requires root permissions. Use {\ttfamily kdb file system/elektra/mountpoints} to find out where exactly it will write to.

Absolute paths are still relative to their namespace (see {\ttfamily kdb info resolver}). Only system+spec mountpoints are actually absolute. Read \hyperlink{md_doc_help_elektra-namespaces_doc_help_elektra-namespaces_md}{elektra-\/namespaces(7)} for further information.

For cascading mountpoints (starting with {\ttfamily /}) a mountpoint for the namespace {\ttfamily dir}, {\ttfamily user} and {\ttfamily system} is created. Each of this mountpoint uses a different configuration file, either below current directory, below home directory or anywhere in the system. Use {\ttfamily kdb file $<$path$>$} to determine where the file(s) are.
