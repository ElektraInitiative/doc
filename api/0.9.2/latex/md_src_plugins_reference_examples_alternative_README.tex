For this example the following configuration is used\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{; this example uses the ni plugin syntax}
\DoxyCodeLine{; 1. metadata}
\DoxyCodeLine{[rootkey/ref]}
\DoxyCodeLine{check/reference = recursive}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{[otherkey/newref]}
\DoxyCodeLine{check/reference = alternative}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{; 2. configuration data}
\DoxyCodeLine{rootkey/ref = ../otherkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherkey/ref = ../yetanotherkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherkey/newref = ../otherotherkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherotherkey/ref = ../nonexistent}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherotherkey/newref = ../mergekey}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{yetanotherkey/ref = ../mergekey}
\DoxyCodeLine{yetanotherkey/newref = ../nonexistent}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{mergekey/ref = ../finalkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{mergekey/newref = ../finalkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{finalkey = ""}
\end{DoxyCode}


We mount it by executing\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cat << EOF > alternative.ini}
\DoxyCodeLine{; this example uses the ni plugin syntax}
\DoxyCodeLine{; 1. metadata}
\DoxyCodeLine{[rootkey/ref]}
\DoxyCodeLine{check/reference = recursive}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{[otherkey/newref]}
\DoxyCodeLine{check/reference = alternative}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{; 2. configuration data}
\DoxyCodeLine{rootkey/ref = ../otherkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherkey/ref = ../yetanotherkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherkey/newref = ../otherotherkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherotherkey/ref = ../nonexistent}
\DoxyCodeLine{otherotherkey/newref = ../mergekey}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{yetanotherkey/ref = ../mergekey}
\DoxyCodeLine{yetanotherkey/newref = ../nonexistent}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{mergekey/ref = ../finalkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{mergekey/newref = ../finalkey}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{finalkey = ""}
\DoxyCodeLine{EOF}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb mount alternative.ini user/tests/reference/alternative ni reference}
\end{DoxyCode}


The file contains a specification, which marks {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/rootkey/ref} as our root reference key and {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/otherkey/newref} as an alternative reference.

The actual configuration contains then a structure which is processed by the plugin like follows\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/rootkey/ref} is read and its reference validated.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/otherkey/ref} is read and its reference validated.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/otherkey/newref} is discovered as an alternative reference and stored for later.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/yetanotherkey/ref} is read and its reference validated.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/mergekey/ref} is read and its reference validated.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/finalkey} does not contain a reference, so we stop here.
\item Processing of the alternative reference chain from {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/otherkey/newref} starts.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/otherkey/newref} is read and its reference validated.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/otherotherkey/newref} is read and its reference validated.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/mergekey/newref} is read and its reference validated.
\item {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/finalkey} does not contain a reference, so we stop here.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The resulting reference graph looks like this\+:



As you can see, the plugin completely ignores {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/yetanotherkey/newref} as well as {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/otherother/ref} and in turn does not throw an error because {\ttfamily user/tests/reference/alternative/nonexistent} does not exist. However, the plugin does still exhaustively check both of the alternative reference chains. If you want to prohibit this, you can set the metakey {\ttfamily check/reference/restrict} to an empty value on whichever key you want to be a leaf node in the graph.

After we are done we can unmount the example with\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb umount user/tests/reference/alternative}
\end{DoxyCode}
