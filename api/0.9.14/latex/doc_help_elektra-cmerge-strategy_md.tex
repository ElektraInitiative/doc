 Elektra\textquotesingle{}s merge library offers different strategies to resolve conflicts in merges without user interaction. Consequently, Elektra\textquotesingle{}s tools all have access to the following merge strategies\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily abort}\+: the merge will abort if any conflict happens and merge the 3 key sets together otherwise.
\item {\ttfamily our}\+: This option forces conflicting keys to be auto-\/resolved cleanly by favoring {\ttfamily our}. Changes from the other key sets that do not conflict with the {\ttfamily our} version are reflected in the merge result. This works like the recursive merge strategy with the {\ttfamily ours} option of git.
\item {\ttfamily their}\+: This is the opposite of {\ttfamily our}. The merge will use the {\ttfamily their} version when a conflict happens.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If no strategy is specified, the merge will default to the abort strategy.
