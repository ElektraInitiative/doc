<li>shortDesc: adds python2 bindings, 3-way merge &amp; improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, we managed to have a great feature release with dozens of corrections!</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p>Thanks to Manuel Mausz for further improving lua, python3 bindings and the new python2 bindings.</p>
<p>The GSoC efforts have their first large contribution to Elektra, the 3 way merge finally arrives with this release. It is still a long way to go, however, because augeas plugins can only be mounted with a workaround and the package integration of the 3-way merge is still in its infancy. More information about GSoC and its progress can be found <a href="http://community.libelektra.org/wp">here</a>.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Felix Berlakovich for his contributions to the 3-way merge, including meta merging, conflict resolving strategies and extensive testing.</p>
<p>Additionally, he added the plugins keytometa, ini and greatly improved the glob plugin. These plugins are technical previews and will receive some improvements in the next release, too.</p>
<p>Now a script for tab completion is available here, again thanks to Felix Berlakovich.</p>
<p>The contextual values now got a <a href="https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/tools/gen">tutorial</a> and small fixes.</p>
<h2>Corrections</h2>
<p>Thanks to Pino Toscano for fixing a lot of spelling errors, simplify RPATH setting, respect $HOME and $TMPDIR, improvements of test cases, and his debian-packaging efforts.</p>
<p>In the kdb tool not allowed subfolders are now checked properly and the output of warnings comes before output of the error. This fixes the problem that in the case of a longer list of warnings one did not see the error anymore.</p>
<p>Fix compilation warnings on clang and gcc 4.9. Also improve test coverage on kdb tool and some plugins.</p>
<p>Fix kdb import/export for some plugins (Should now work with any storage plugin again).</p>
<p>kdb run_all should run flawlessly with this release. Remaining problems with not installed test data were fixed. kdb run_all also checks if the test cases do not modify any existing key and keeps a backup if this happened.</p>
<p>Some remaining mem leaks in rare circumstances were fixed. Valgrind should now never report any leaks, if it does, please report the issue.</p>
<h2>API Changes</h2>
<p>Added delMeta() for C++, because setMeta() with NULL will set the number 0 and not remove the meta.</p>
<p>Arguments of isBelow, isDirectBelow, isBelowOrSame are swapped for better readability. k.isBelow(root) now means the obvious thing. The change only effects the C++ binding, keyIsBelow is unaffected by the change.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><a href="/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/doc/METADATA.ini">Specification of metadata</a> and <a href="/home/markus/Projekte/Elektra/current/doc/CONTRACT.ini">contracts</a> written/greatly improved.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="doc_decisions_README_md.html">Decisions</a> are introduced again.</p>
<p>Most often the KeySet is ideal, e.g. when doing full iteration or when performing set operations. In some cases, however, a hierarchical data structure fits better. This is especially true for GUIs. Luckily, Keys can be in multiple data structures because of their reference counting.</p>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<p>We now fully embrace github:</p><ul>
<li>We use its issue tracker (all issues from local text files were moved there)</li>
<li>We have rewritten many READMEs to use githubs markdown</li>
<li>On pull requests the build server checks if the merge would break the build.</li>
<li>All previous gitorious users are now at github. (Most had an account anyway)</li>
</ul>
<p>Raffael Pancheri also made progress with its qt-gui. It now features a model that implements great parts of Elektraâ€™s features. Unfortunately the model cannot be serialised and thus changes cannot made persistent. Also undo and other important use-cases are still not there. The GUI looks very clean and was evaluated in a SUS study on 23.07.2014. The current implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/0003088/qt-gui">here</a>.</p>
<p>Many distributions already have Elektra packages</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/elektra/">Fedora</a></li>
<li><a href="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-admin/elektra">Gentoo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/elektra/">Arch Linux</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In some distributions Elektra packages are available, but are not up-to-date. Pino Toscano is working on get them (actually Debian, but others are derived from it) up-to-date.</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/elektra">Ubuntu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/de/wheezy/libelektra3">Debian</a></li>
<li><a href="http://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/elektra">Linux Mint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A special thanks to Kai-Uwe Behrmann for providing packages for <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Abekun&amp;package=elektra">CentOS, Fedora, OpenSUSE, RHEL and SLE</a>.</p>
