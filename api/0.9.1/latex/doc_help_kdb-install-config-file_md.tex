{\ttfamily kdb install-\/config-\/file $<$elektra path$>$ $<$config file$>$ \mbox{[}$<$format$>$\mbox{]}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily $<$elektra path$>$} is a path in Elektra
\item {\ttfamily $<$config file$>$} is some file on the filesystem
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily line} will be used as {\ttfamily $<$format$>$} if {\ttfamily $<$format$>$} is unspecified.

The script has to be called as administrator (e.\+g. with {\ttfamily sudo}).

This script installs or merges configuration files from the file system into Elektra. There are two possible scenarios\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item You use the script for the first time for a file. Then {\ttfamily $<$elektra path$>$} is empty. The script
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item copies {\ttfamily $<$config file$>$} into a special path to preserve origin version.
\item mounts {\ttfamily $<$config file$>$} into {\ttfamily $<$elektra path$>$} as our version. This version can then be safely modified.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item You have already used the script for a previous version of the file. In this case {\ttfamily $<$elektra path$>$} already contains data the script performs a three-\/way merge (using {\ttfamily kdb cmerge}) between the file at {\ttfamily $<$config file$>$} (their), the {\ttfamily $<$elektra path$>$} (our) and the preserved key set (base) from step 1 in scenario 1.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To install the config file at {\ttfamily $\sim$/.config/installing.\+ini} we can use the following command

{\ttfamily kdb install-\/config-\/file user/tests/installing installing.\+ini ini}
