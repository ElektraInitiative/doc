This plugin is a type checker plugin using the {\ttfamily C\+O\+R\+BA} data types.

A common and successful type system happens to be C\+O\+R\+BA. The system is well suited because of the many well-\/defined mappings it provides to other programming languages.

The type checker plugin supports all basic C\+O\+R\+BA types\+: {\ttfamily short}, {\ttfamily unsigned\+\_\+short}, {\ttfamily long}, {\ttfamily unsigned\+\_\+long}, {\ttfamily long\+\_\+long}, {\ttfamily unsigned\+\_\+long\+\_\+long}, {\ttfamily float}, {\ttfamily double}, {\ttfamily char}, {\ttfamily boolean}, {\ttfamily any} and {\ttfamily octet}. When checking {\ttfamily any} it will always be successful, regardless of the content.

\subsection*{Deprecation}

{\ttfamily empty} and {\ttfamily F\+S\+Type} are deprecated. Please use regular expressions or enums instead.

Sometimes the type should expresses that, for example, both an empty or another type is valid. This type checker allowed a space-\/separated list of types to expresses that. If any of those types match, the whole type was valid. For example, the type {\ttfamily string empty} equals the type {\ttfamily any}. This facility builds a union of the sets of instances existing types specify. It is now deprecated due to a more general sum type facility.

\subsection*{Example}


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo kdb mount typetest.dump user/typetest dump type
kdb set user/typetest/key a
kdb setmeta user/typetest/key check/type char

kdb get user/typetest/key
#> a

kdb rm user/typetest/key
sudo kdb umount user/typetest
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Limitations}

{\ttfamily wchar} is missing.

Enum and records are part of other plugins.

The {\ttfamily C\+O\+R\+BA} type system also has its limits. The types {\ttfamily string} and {\ttfamily enum} can be unsatisfactory. While string is too general and makes no limit on how the sequence of characters is structured, the enumeration is too finite. For example, it is not possible to say that a string is not allowed to have a specific symbol in it. Combine this plugin with other type checker plugins to circumvent such limitations.
