Currently multiple warnings are saved in an elektra non-\/conforming array notation which is limited to 100 entries. The notation of {\ttfamily \#00} is against the design \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_decisions_array_md}{decision made}}.

The format should be aligned with the correct array notation, starting with {\ttfamily \#0}. The maximum number of warnings will stay at 100 entries ({\ttfamily \#0} -\/ {\ttfamily \#\+\_\+99}).

To keep the ordering we add an underscore {\ttfamily \+\_\+} once we go to beyond 10 warnings ({\ttfamily \#\+\_\+10}).
