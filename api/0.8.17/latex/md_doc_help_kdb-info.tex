This command will print out all the information about an Elektra plugin except it's configuration. This command will also print out any functions that are exported by the plugin. Information about a plugin will be read from {\ttfamily system/elektra/modules/}. If the information could not be located there, such as when a plugin is not mounted, the module will be loaded dynamically and then the information will be requested directly from the plugin. If a user wishes to load the information directly from the plugin, they can force that by using the {\ttfamily -\/l} option.
