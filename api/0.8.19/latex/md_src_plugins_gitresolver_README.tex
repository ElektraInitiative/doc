gitresolver is a resolver that fetches from a local git repository during the get-\/phase and commits them back at the end of the set-\/phase. It operates on a temporary copy of the latest version of your file fetched from the repository. If the temporary copy modified, a new commit with the modified version will be created. Local files won't be touched.

\subsection*{Options}

{\ttfamily branch} defines the branch to work on. Default\+: master {\ttfamily tracking} can be either {\ttfamily object} or {\ttfamily head} (default). if set to {\ttfamily object} a conflict will only occur if the file in the git repository has been updated while you were working on it. {\ttfamily head} will cause a conflict if the {\ttfamily H\+E\+A\+D} commit has been updated.

\subsection*{Limitations}

Currently it only works on already existing files inside existing git repositories.

\subsection*{Examples}

\begin{DoxyVerb}kdb mount -R gitresolver /path/to/my/gitrepo/file.ini system/gittest ini shell execute/set='cd /path/to/my/gitrepo/ && git commit --amend'\end{DoxyVerb}
