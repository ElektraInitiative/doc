{\itshape Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.}



Elektra provides a mature, consistent and easily comprehensible API. Its modularity effectively avoids code duplication across applications and tools concerning their configuration tasks. Elektra abstracts from cross-\/platform-\/related issues and enables applications to be aware of other applications\textquotesingle{} configurations, leveraging easy application integration.\hypertarget{README_md_autotoc_md4895}{}\doxysection{Often Used Links}\label{README_md_autotoc_md4895}

Elektra provides benefits for\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\itshape Application Developers} by making it easier to access configuration settings in a modular, reliable, and extensible way.
\item {\itshape System Administrators} by making it possible to access configuration settings in the same way applications access them.
\item {\itshape Everyone} by making application integration possible and less misconfiguration a reality.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Elektra consists of three parts\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\itshape Lib\+Elektra} is a modular configuration access toolkit to construct and integrate applications into a global, hierarchical key database. The building blocks are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item language bindings (inclusive high-\/level interfaces)
\item Gen\+Elektra, the code generator for type-\/safe bindings
\item plugins for configuration access behavior and validation
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Spec\+Elektra} is a configuration specification language that is easy to use and self-\/contained in the same key database (i.\+e. written in any of the configuration file formats Elektra supports).
\item Tools on top of Lib\+Elektra for system administrators, such as CLI tools, web UIs, and GUIs.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To highlight a few concrete things about Elektra, configuration settings can come from any data source, but usually comes from configuration files that are \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_help_elektra-mounting_md}{\+\_\+mounted\+\_\+}} into Elektra similar to mounting a file system. Elektra is a plugin-\/based framework, for example, plugins implement various configuration formats like INI, JSON, XML, etc. There is a lot more to discover like executing scripts ({\ttfamily python}, {\ttfamily lua} or {\ttfamily shell}) when a configuration value changes, or, enhanced validation plugins that will not allow corrupted configuration settings to reach your application.

As an application developer you get instant access to various configuration formats and the ability to fallback to default configuration settings without having to deal with this on your own. As an system administrator you can choose your favorite configuration format and {\itshape mount} this configuration for the application. {\itshape Mounting} enables easy application integration as any application using Elektra can access any {\itshape mounted} configuration. You can even {\itshape mount} {\ttfamily /etc} files such as {\ttfamily hosts} or {\ttfamily fstab}, so that there is no need to configure the same values twice in different files.

In case you are worried about linking to such a powerful library. The core is a small library implemented in C, works cross-\/platform, and does not need any external dependencies. There are bindings for other languages in case C is too low-\/level for you.\hypertarget{README_md_autotoc_md4897}{}\doxysection{Contact}\label{README_md_autotoc_md4897}

Take a look at \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_IDEAS_md}{how to start contributing}}.\hypertarget{README_md_autotoc_md4907}{}\doxysection{Goals}\label{README_md_autotoc_md4907}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make developer\textquotesingle{}s life easier by proving a well-\/tested mature library instead of rolling your own configuration system for every application. This reduces rank growth of configuration systems (including but not limited to configuration file parsers) in our ecosystem and fosters well-\/maintained plugins instead.
\item Postpone configuration decisions (such as which configuration files to use) from developers to system administrators and package maintainers to provide an overall more consistent and user-\/friendly system. (Default behavior of applications still is in control of developers, you can even roll your own plugins to provide exactly the same behavior as your application has now.)
\item Make configuration storage more safe\+: avoid that applications receive wrong or unexpected values that could lead to undefined behavior.
\end{DoxyItemize}

And in terms of quality, we want\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Simplicity (make configuration tasks, like access of configuration settings, simple),
\item Robustness (no undefined behavior of applications), and
\item Extensibility (gain control over configuration access)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
