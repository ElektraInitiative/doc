This plugin parses {\ttfamily passwd} files, e.\+g. {\ttfamily /etc/passwd}.

\subsection*{Implementation Details}

If present, the not-\/posix compliant {\ttfamily fgetpwent} function will be used to read the file supplied by the resolver, otherwise {\ttfamily getpwent} will be used. For writing, if present, {\ttfamily putpwent} will be used, if not a simple implementation writing straight to the config file.

\subsection*{Configuration}

If the config key {\ttfamily index} is set to {\ttfamily name} passwd entrys will be sorted by name, if not set or set to {\ttfamily uid} passwd entries will be sorted by uid

\subsection*{Fields}
