{\ttfamily kdb mv $<$source$>$ $<$dest$>$}

Where {\ttfamily source} is the path of the key(s) you want to copy and {\ttfamily dest} is the path where you would like to move the key(s) to. Note that when using the {\ttfamily -\/r} flag, {\ttfamily source} as well as all of the keys below it will be moved.

This command moves key(s) in the Key database. You can move keys to other paths within the database.

Neither {\ttfamily source} nor {\ttfamily dest} can be a cascading key. (Start with {\ttfamily /}). Make sure to select a namespace.
