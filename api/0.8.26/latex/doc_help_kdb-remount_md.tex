{\ttfamily kdb remount $<$new path$>$ $<$new mount point$>$ $<$existing mount point$>$}

Where {\ttfamily new path} is the path to the file the user wants to mount, (Absolute for system files, relative for user files)~\newline
 {\ttfamily new mount point} is where in the key database the new configuration file should be mounted at, (For a cascading mount pount, {\ttfamily mountpoint} should start with {\ttfamily /})~\newline
 and {\ttfamily existing mount point} is the mount point where the existing backend is mounted.~\newline


\subsection*{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+ON}

This command allows a user to use an existing backend (such as one from a previous mount) to mount a new configuration file to a new mount point in the key database.~\newline
