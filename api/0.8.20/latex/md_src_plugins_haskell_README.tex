A plugin which takes care about initializing the haskell run-\/time.

\subsection*{Usage}

This plugin on its own provides a minimalistic implementation to test the basic functionality, but acts as a base for developing further haskell plugins.

Use the cmake command add\+\_\+haskell\+\_\+plugin which can used by including Lib\+Add\+Haskell\+Plugin. This command will take care about the proper linking of your haskell plugin. Furthermore it uses the c wrapper provided by this plugin so this doesn\textquotesingle{}t have to be done again.
