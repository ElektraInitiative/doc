Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store configuration parameters in a global, hierarchical key database.

The core is a small library implemented in C. The plugin-\/based framework fulfills many configuration-\/related tasks to avoid any unnecessary code duplication across applications while it still allows the core to stay without any external dependency. Elektra abstracts from cross-\/platform-\/related issues with an consistent A\+P\+I, and allows applications to be aware of other applications' configurations, leveraging easy application integration.

The man pages can also be viewed online at\+: \href{http://doc.libelektra.org/api/current/html/pages.html}{\tt http\+://doc.\+libelektra.\+org/api/current/html/pages.\+html}
