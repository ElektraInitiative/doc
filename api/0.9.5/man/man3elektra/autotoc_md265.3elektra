infos/description = This plugin reads and writes /etc/hosts files\&.
.PP
.PP
The \fC/etc/hosts\fP file is a simple text file that associates IP addresses with hostnames, one line per IP address\&. The format is described in \fChosts(5)\fP\&.
.PP
The \fChosts\fP plugins transforms the information of this file to the following structure\&. The keys directly below \fCipv4\fP or \fCipv6\fP are host names of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, respectively\&. The keys directly below these keys are aliases\&. The IP addresses themselves are stored as values\&.
.PP
Canonical hostnames are stored as key base names with their IP addresses as value\&.
.PP
Aliases are stored as keys directly below canonical hostnames with a read-only duplicate of the associated IP address as value\&.
.PP
Comments are stored according to the comment metadata specification (see \fC/doc/METADATA\&.ini\fP for more information)\&.
.PP
The ordering of the hosts is stored in metakeys of type \fCorder\fP\&. The value is an ascending number\&. Ordering of aliases is \fInot\fP preserved\&.
.PP
Mount the plugin:
.PP
.PP
.nf
sudo kdb mount --with-recommends /etc/hosts system:/hosts hosts
.fi
.PP
.PP
Print out all known hosts and their aliases:
.PP
.PP
.nf
kdb ls system:/hosts
.fi
.PP
.PP
Get IP address of ipv4 host 'localhost':
.PP
.PP
.nf
kdb get system:/hosts/ipv4/localhost
.fi
.PP
.PP
Check if a comment is belonging to host 'localhost':
.PP
.PP
.nf
kdb meta-ls system:/hosts/ipv4/localhost
.fi
.PP
.PP
Try to change the host 'localhost', should fail because it is not an IPv4 address:
.PP
.PP
.nf
sudo kdb set system:/hosts/ipv4/localhost ::1
.fi
.PP
.PP
``` 
.SH "Backup-and-Restore:/tests/hosts"
.PP
sudo kdb mount --with-recommends hosts /tests/hosts hosts
.SH "Create hosts file for testing"
.PP
echo '127\&.0\&.0\&.1 localhost' > \fCkdb file /tests/hosts\fP echo '::1 localhost' >> \fCkdb file /tests/hosts\fP
.SH "Check the file"
.PP
cat \fCkdb file /tests/hosts\fP #> 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 localhost #> ::1 localhost
.SH "Check if the values are read correctly"
.PP
kdb get /tests/hosts/ipv4/localhost #> 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 kdb get /tests/hosts/ipv6/localhost #> ::1
.SH "Should both fail with error 04200 and return 5"
.PP
kdb set /tests/hosts/ipv4/localhost ::1 
.SH "RET:5"
.PP
.SH "ERROR:C03200"
.PP
kdb set /tests/hosts/ipv6/localhost 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 
.SH "RET:5"

.PP
.SH "cleanup"
.PP
kdb rm -r /tests/hosts sudo kdb umount /tests/hosts ```
.SS "Limitations"
.IP "\(bu" 2
host names are not validated, see https://issues.libelektra.org/2185
.IP "\(bu" 2
duplicates, where a host names is the same as an alias name, are not rejected, see https://issues.libelektra.org/3461
.IP "\(bu" 2
keys that do not confirm to the hierarchy are ignored
