This plugin reads and writes files written in a basic line-\/oriented ini-\/like format. It is very simplistic without sections, the \hyperlink{md_src_plugins_ini_README_src_plugins_ini_README_md}{ini} plugin and for specifications the \hyperlink{md_src_plugins_ni_README_src_plugins_ni_README_md}{ni} plugin should be preferred in most cases. Since the {\ttfamily simpleini} plugin requires the G\+NU C library it {\bfseries will not work} on operating systems that use another C library such as mac\+OS.

\subsection*{Usage}

It is quite suitable to export configuration if you want line-\/by-\/line key, value pairs without sections or metadata. (Thus +3000 in status) \begin{DoxyVerb}$ kdb export system/samba simpleini
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Configuration}

The only parameter simpleini supports is {\ttfamily format} which allows you to change the syntax of individual lines. The {\ttfamily format} is a string with any characters where only {\ttfamily \%} has special meaning\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \%} in an even number N are escaped and represent N/2 {\ttfamily \%}, e.\+g. {\ttfamily \%\%\%\%} are actually {\ttfamily \%\%} in the resulting format.
\item The first unescaped {\ttfamily \%} represents the key.
\item The second unescaped {\ttfamily \%} represents the value.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The default is {\ttfamily \% = \%}.

For example, if you want every key to be marked {\ttfamily \%\+:key value} you would use\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ kdb export -c "format=%%:% %" system/samba simpleini
%:key value
%:key2 value2
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Restrictions}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Lines in a different format (e.\+g. comments) are discarded.
\item The order per line must be key and then value\+: the plugin cannot be used if the value is first
\item Whitespace before and after keynames are trimmed (but not for value)
\item Delimiting symbols cannot be part of the key.
\item The last occurrence of the same key wins (others are discarded).
\item The parent Key cannot be used.
\item This plugin needs the code and null plugins. A code plugin is used for the escape character for some symbols (but does not respect user-\/defined {\ttfamily format}) and the null plugin is used to handle null values.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Examples}

Mount the plugin\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ kdb mount -d /etc/samba/smb.conf system/samba ccode null simpleini
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Limitations}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item will be excluded in Mac OS X
\item cannot parse entries where key or value is missing
