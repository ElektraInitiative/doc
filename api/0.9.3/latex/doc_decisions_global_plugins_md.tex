\item Notification does not happen once after final commit, but for every plugin
\item Problems in spec plugin
\end{DoxyItemize}

These problems can be traced back to the placement of the plugins. We need to cleanup and simplify the placement.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Plugin interface should be the same. Many plugins, e.\+g. dbus, should work as global plugins w/o any change in code (i.\+e. only changes in contract)
\item Global plugins might depend on specific applications or specific mount points (it should be possible to enforce global plugins for specific applications).
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Elektra is useful with following types of global plugins\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item mmap
\item spec
\item gopts
\item receiving of notifications (internalnotification)
\item sending of notifications (dbus, ...)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item There are not too many types of global plugins, not more than 10
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item generic placements like /prerollback /rollback /postrollback /getresolver /pregetcache /pregetstorage /getstorage /postgetstorage /postgetcache /setresolver /presetstorage /setstorage /precommit /commit /postcommit which can be executed at\+: /init /deinit /foreach proved to be too complicated and untestable.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Have hooks and A\+PI specific to the list of global plugins in assumptions. These hooks are not shared, so no {\ttfamily list} plugin is needed.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item allows adding more types of plugins later, also post-\/1.\+0
\item much clearer semantics for each type, no need to compromise
\item easier to implement
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item remove {\ttfamily list} plugin
\item remove plugins that stop working or disallow global positioning for them
\item call {\ttfamily spec} as needed several times
\end{DoxyItemize}
