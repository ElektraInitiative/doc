<h1>0.8.10 Release</h1>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>we are delighted to announce our latest feature release providing
major updates in:</p>

<ul>
<li>compatibility with standards,</li>
<li>tooling,</li>
<li>plugins (hosts, rename),</li>
<li>Qt-Gui and</li>
<li>a new Java binding</li>
</ul>


<h2>XDG Compatibility</h2>

<p>Elektra now is
<a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.8.html">fully XDG 0.8</a>
compliant. Following changes were necessary:</p>

<ul>
<li>newly created configuration files for user/ now have the permissions
0600</li>
<li>newly created configuration directories for user/ now have the
permissions 0700</li>
<li>existing configuration files will retain their permissions.</li>
<li>The default path to store user configuration is now ~/.config</li>
<li>A new resolver variant x (for user and system) is introduced</li>
<li>implements handling of XDG environment variables</li>
<li>ignores empty dirs and absolute paths in envvar</li>
<li>add new shell based test suite for (xdg)-resolver</li>
</ul>


<p>For example, we could use resolver_fm_xhp_x:</p>

<pre><code>kdb mount --resolver=resolver_fm_xhp_x file.dump /example dump
kdb file user/example
kdb file system/example
</code></pre>

<p>Will show you that for both user+system the resolver respects
XDG environment variables, e.g. above lines will print:</p>

<pre><code>/home/m/.config/file.dump
/etc/xdg/file.dump
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, any attempts to get and set keys below user/example and
system/example will also be in these files.</p>

<p>The letters after _ describe the variant of the resolver:</p>

<ul>
<li>f .. file based locking</li>
<li>m .. mutex based locking (for multiple KDB per process)</li>
<li>for user configuration (after next _)</li>
<li>x .. first check XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment</li>
<li>h .. then check HOME environment</li>
<li>p .. then fall back to passwd</li>
<li>for system configuration (after next _)</li>
<li>x .. check all paths in XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and falls back to /etc/xdg</li>
</ul>


<p>A lot of such resolver variants are added when -DPLUGINS=ALL is used.
Of course you can create new variants with different behaviour by adding
them to PLUGINS.</p>

<p>To make your application (that uses Elektra) XDG aware, you have nothing
to do: you get it to free. Make sure to always use cascading lookup.
Additionally, an XDG conforming application should not write system/
keys.</p>

<h2>OpenICC Compatibility</h2>

<p>Based on that, Elektra now also implements the draft for
<a href="http://www.openicc.info/wiki/index.php?title=OpenICC_Configuration_0.1">the OpenICC specification</a>.</p>

<p>The mount command looks like quite complicated, but it consists of
simple parts:</p>

<pre><code>kdb mount --resolver=resolver_fm_xhp_x \
  color/settings/openicc-devices.json /org/freedesktop/openicc \
  yajl rename cut=org/freedesktop/openicc
</code></pre>

<p>We already know the first two lines: we use the XDG resolver already
introduced above. Only the file name and the path where it should be
mounted differs.</p>

<p>The plugin yajl is a storage plugin that reads/writes json. The plugin
rename was the missing link to support OpenICC (thanks to Felix
Berlakovich for closing this gap). It is needed, because every OpenICC
file starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>{ "org": { "freedesktop": { "openicc": {
</code></pre>

<p>Because the backend is mounted at /org/freedesktop/openicc, it would
lead to keys below /org/freedesktop/openicc/org/freedesktop/openicc
which we obviously do not want. So we simply get rid of the common
prefix by cutting it out using the rename plugin.</p>

<p>Of course this renaming functionality can be used in every situation and
is not limited to OpenICC.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>A large number of old and new tools were added, mostly for convenience
e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>kdb mount-openicc
</code></pre>

<p>saves you from writing the long mount command we had in the previous
section.</p>

<p>To get a list of all tools that are installed, now the command (which is
also an external tool and as such currently not displayed in kdb &ndash;help):</p>

<pre><code>kdb list-tools
</code></pre>

<p>is available. Do not be surprised: on typical installations this will
be a large list. You can run each of these tools by using kdb <command>.
Most of the tools, however, are part of the test suite,
which you can run using:</p>

<pre><code>kdb run_all
</code></pre>

<p>Other tools are &ldquo;old friends&rdquo;, e.g. convert-fstab written in 2006 by Avi
Alkalay still works:</p>

<pre><code>kdb convert-fstab | kdb import system/filesystems xmltool
</code></pre>

<p>It will parse your /etc/fstab and generate a XML. This XML then can be
imported. Other convert tools directly produce kdb commands, though.</p>

<p>kdb now uses KDB itself for many commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>/sw/kdb/current/resolver .. You always want a different default
  resolver than that was compiled in as default when mounting
  backends?</li>
<li>/sw/kdb/current/format .. If you are annoyed by the default format
  dump format for import/export.</li>
<li>/sw/kdb/current/plugins .. If you always forget to add some plugins
  when mounting something.</li>
</ul>


<p>By default the plugin &ldquo;sync&rdquo; is added automatically (it makes sure that
fsync is executed on config files, the directory is already done by the
resolver), you should not remove it from /sw/kdb/current/plugins
otherwise the next mount command will not add it. To preserve it use a
space separated list, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>kdb set user/sw/kdb/current/plugins "sync syslog"
</code></pre>

<p>Last, but not least, kdb get now supports cascading get:</p>

<pre><code>kdb get /sw/kdb/current/plugins
</code></pre>

<p>This feature allows you to see the configuration exactly as seen by the
application.</p>

<p>Other options:</p>

<ul>
<li>-123 options for hiding nth column in <code>kdb mount</code></li>
<li>hide warnings during script usage of <code>kdb mount</code></li>
<li>-0 option accepted in some tools (null termination)</li>
<li>Mount got a new -c option for backend configuration. For example
-c cut=org/freedesktop/openicc would be the parameter cut for all
plugins. Have a look at #146 if you want to use it.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>The core API (kdb.h), as always, stayed API/ABI compatible. The only
changes in kdb.h is the addition of KEY_CASCADING_NAME and
KEY_META_NAME. So applications compiled against 0.8.10 and using these
constants, will not work with Elektra 0.8.9.</p>

<p>The constants allow us to create following kinds of keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>empty names: this was always possible, because invalid names
(including empty names) did not cause keyNew to abort</li>
<li>metanames: this is a new feature that allows us to compare key names
with metakeys</li>
<li>cascading names: names starting with / have the special meaning that
they do not specify which namespace they have. When such names are
used for

<ul>
<li>kdbGet() and kdbSet() keys are retrieved from all namespaces</li>
<li>ksLookup() keys are searched in all namespaces</li>
<li>ksLookupByName() is now just a wrapper for ksLookup().
  The method does not do much except creating a key and passing
  them to ksLookup().</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Usage in C is:</p>

<pre><code>Key *c = keyNew("/org/freedesktop", KEY_CASCADING_NAME, KEY_END);
Key *m = keyNew("comment/#0", KEY_META_NAME, KEY_END);
</code></pre>

<p>The same functionality exists, of course, in available in all bindings,
too.</p>

<p>Changes in non-core API are:</p>

<ul>
<li>xmltool now does not output default (unchanged) uid,gid and mode</li>
<li>ksLookupBySpec from kdbproposal.h was removed, is now integrated into
  ksLookup</li>
<li>extension keyNameGetNamespace was removed</li>
<li>the hosts comment format has changed</li>
<li>the default resolver has changed (uses passwd)</li>
<li>kdb::tools::Backend::Backend constructor, tryPlugin and addPlugin
have changed:</li>
<li>mountname is now automatically calculated</li>
<li>addPlugin allows us to add a KeySet to validate plugins with different
  contracts correctly</li>
<li>C++ binding now throws std::bad_alloc on allocation problems (and not
InvalidName)</li>
</ul>


<h2>CMake</h2>

<p>It is now possible to remove a plugin/binding/tools by prefixing a name
with &ldquo;-&rdquo;.  The new &ldquo;-element&rdquo; syntax is accepted by TOOLS, BINDINGS and
PLUGINS. It is very handy in combination with ALL, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>-DPLUGINS="ALL;-xmltool"
</code></pre>

<p>will include all plugins except xmltool.</p>

<h2>Improved comments</h2>

<p>Comment preserving was improved a lot. Especially, the hosts plugin was
rewritten completely. Now multiple different comment styles can be
intermixed without losing information. E.g. some INI formats support
both ; and # for comments. With the new comments it is possible to
preserve that information and even better: applications can iterate
over that information (metadata).</p>

<p>To mount the new hosts plugin use (if you already have mounted it, you
have nothing to do):</p>

<pre><code>kdb mount /etc/hosts system/hosts hosts
</code></pre>

<p>The hosts plugin now seperates from ipv4 and ipv6 which makes the host
names canonical again, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>kdb get system/hosts/ipv4/localhost
kdb get system/hosts/ipv6/localhost
</code></pre>

<p>To access the inline-comment, use:</p>

<pre><code>kdb getmeta system/hosts/ipv4/localhost "comment/#0"
</code></pre>

<p>For other meta information, see:</p>

<pre><code>kdb lsmeta system/hosts/ipv4/localhost
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, a small API for specific metadata operations emerges.
These operations will be moved to a separate library and will not stay
in Elektra&rsquo;s core library.</p>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<ul>
<li>lookup options:</li>
<li>KDB_O_SPEC uses the lookup key as specification</li>
<li>KDB_O_CREATE creates a key if it could not be found</li>
<li>elektraKeyGetMetaKeySet creates a KeySet from metadata</li>
<li>elektraKsFilter allows us to filter a KeySet arbitrarily (not only
  keyIsBelow in case of ksCut). It reintroduces more functional
  programming.</li>
<li>keyGetNamespace was reintroduced. In one of the next versions of
Elektra we will introduce new namespaces. keyGetNamespace allows the
compiler to output a warning when some namespaces are not handled in
your C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Java binding</h2>

<p>Elektra now fully supports applications written in Java and also Plugins
written in the same language.</p>

<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/bindings/jna">new binding was developed using jna.</a>
For the
<a href="https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/plugins/jni">plugin interface JNI</a>
was used.
We developed already
<a href="https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/bindings/jna/elektra/plugin">some plugins</a>.</p>

<h2>Qt-Gui</h2>

<p>Raffael Pancheri released the version 0.0.2 of the Qt-Gui:</p>

<ul>
<li>added Backend Wizard for mounting</li>
<li>user can hover over TreeView items and quickly see keyname, keyvalue
and metakeys</li>
<li>it is now easily possible to create and edit arrays</li>
<li>added header to MetaArea for better clarity</li>
<li>many small layout and view update fixes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Further stuff and small fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Two new error/warnings information: mountpoint and configfile.
  It is added automatically and all tools will print it.</li>
<li>C++ I/O for key(s) now allows null terminator next to new-line
  terminator</li>
<li>fix error plugin: now use on_open/trigger_warnings to be consistent</li>
<li>fix metaset: now correctly append new key</li>
<li>arrays are also available when compiled with mingw
 (but tests still have to be excluded for successful compilation)</li>
<li>fix #136</li>
<li>fix long help text in <code>kdb check</code></li>
<li>signed release tags are now used</li>
</ul>
