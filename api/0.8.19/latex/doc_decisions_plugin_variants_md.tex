\subsection*{Issue}

Some plugins are generic in the sense that they cannot fully define their contract statically. (Note\+: if they can decide it statically, you should prefer \hyperlink{doc_tutorials_compilation-variants_md}{compilation variants}.) Instead their contract is based on their configuration. We will call every combination of plugins+configuration where we get a different contract {\bfseries plugin variant}.

The current issue is that there is no way to enumerate possible plugin variants as needed to list all functionality of Elektra.

\subsection*{Constraints}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item User Customizability\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Users must be able to add new plugin variants
\item Users should be able to suppress plugin variants
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Modularity\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugins themselves yield a list of plugin variants
\item The code defining variants is part of the plugin's code
\item To get a full list of all variants of all plugins, one simply has to iterate over all plugins and ask the plugins for possible variants.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item libtool should provide a convenience layer for easy access of all plugin variants. In this case there should also be a performance optimization, that plugins do not need to be reopened required multiple times.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Assumptions}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The number of variants needs to be bounded\+: plugin variants need to be fully enumerable
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Considered Alternatives}

A specification of the plugin's configuration and a tool that can enumerate all possible essential configurations. Issues here are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Plugins might need to self-\/reference (a validation plugin might have plugin variants, too)
\item Elektra's specification language was not complete nor consistent at point of writing
\item Does not fit with the {\ttfamily checkconf} (\href{http://git.libelektra.org/issues/559}{\tt see here}) approach.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Decision}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Provide a function {\ttfamily int genconf (Key\+Set $\ast$ ks, Key $\ast$ error\+Key)} where {\ttfamily ks} is filled with a list of all variants with the essential configuration (subkeys {\ttfamily config}) and the changed parts of the contract (subkeys {\ttfamily infos}).
\item Keys defined in {\ttfamily system/elektra/plugins/variants} have the same content, but take precedence. If a variant with the same name is defined, only {\ttfamily config} or {\ttfamily infos} from {\ttfamily genconf} are considered if they are not mentioned in {\ttfamily system/elektra/plugins/variants}. If the keys {\ttfamily config} or {\ttfamily infos} are present, it will be overwritten (deleted), if only subkeys thereof are present, it will be enhanced.
\item Empty {\ttfamily config} and {\ttfamily infos} mean\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily config}\+: The \char`\"{}default variant\char`\"{} (without any parameter) should be also available (has useful functionality)
\item {\ttfamily infos}\+: It is not possible to determine the changes of the contract, the user need to instantiate the plugin and enquiry the contract.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Example}

{\ttfamily genconf} for augeas yields\+: ``` access access/config access/config/lens = Access.\+lns access/infos access/infos/format = access aliases aliases/config aliases/config/lens = Aliases.\+lns aliases/config/path = /etc/aliases aliases/infos aliases/infos/format = aliases ```

{\ttfamily genconf} for python yields\+: ``` configparser/config configparser/config/script = python\+\_\+configparser.\+py ```

the user specifies\+: ``` system/elektra/plugins/variants/access system/elektra/plugins/variants/aliases/infos/status = 10000 system/elektra/plugins/variants/configparser system/elektra/plugins/variants/configparser/config system/elektra/plugins/variants/configparser/config/script = mybetter\+\_\+configparser.\+py ```

then the plugin variant\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily access} is not available ({\ttfamily system/elektra/plugins/variants/access} overrides {\ttfamily genconf})
\item {\ttfamily aliases} as defined from {\ttfamily genconf}, but with changes in contract ({\ttfamily infos/status})
\item {\ttfamily configparser} is completely redefined (result from {\ttfamily genconf} will not be considered)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Argument}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily genconf} A\+P\+I was chosen to be consistent with {\ttfamily checkconf}. The pluginhandle might be missing for some scenarios. If it is needed, we should change both A\+P\+Is for consistency reasons.
\item The very verbose (deeply nested) subkeys (and names instead of arrays) provide better customizability and extensibility.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Implications}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily genconf} needs to be implemented for the plugins\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item augeas
\item jni
\item lua
\item python
\item python2
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Plugin\+Database} needs an extension to list all plugin variants
\item {\ttfamily kdb list} should be able to list all variants, e.\+g. like\+: {\ttfamily augeas lens=Access.\+lns} {\ttfamily augeas format=access} so that a user can copy and paste this for the {\ttfamily kdb mount} command.
