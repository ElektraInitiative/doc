This command is used to create a new {\ttfamily fstab} entry. Due to the unique format of {\ttfamily fstab} entries, it is not possible to set individual elements of new {\ttfamily fstab} entries. This command is used to gather all the data needed to create a single {\ttfamily fstab} entry in order to bypass the issue of not being able to set individual elements. This command will create the new entry with a name of {\ttfamily Z\+Z\+Z\+New\+Fstab\+Name} which should then automatically be renamed by the {\ttfamily fstab} plugin.
