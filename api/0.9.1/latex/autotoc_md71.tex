This caching plugin stores keysets from previous {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga28e385fd9cb7ccfe0b2f1ed2f62453a1}{kdb\+Get()}}} calls to improve performance when reading configuration files.

The cache plugin is compiled and enabled on compatible systems by default. No actions are needed to enable it.

P\+O\+S\+IX compliant system (including X\+SI extensions). The plugin is only compiled if the plugins {\ttfamily resolver} and {\ttfamily mmapstorage} are also available.

Incompatible with storage plugins, which do not always produce the same keyset on any invocation concerning the same configuration file. A notable example here is the {\ttfamily ini} plugin (see issue \#2592).

The cache files are located in the user\textquotesingle{}s home directory below {\ttfamily $\sim$/.cache/elektra/} and shall not be altered, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
