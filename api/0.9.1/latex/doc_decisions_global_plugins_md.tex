\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Checker plugins see only part of the configuration and cannot check constraints between keys of different mount points
\item Notification does not happen once after final commit, but for every plugin
\item Some plugins are not implementable, e.\+g. global locks (that lock before any other plugin and unlock after any other), but also journal plugins that keep track of actions to be done and already done
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use list-\/plugin in configuration and allow arbitrary number of global plugins
\item Plugin interface should be the same. Many plugins, e.\+g. dbus, should work as global plugins w/o any change in code (i.\+e. only changes in contract)
\item Global plugins might depend on specific applications or specific mount points (it should be possible to enforce global plugins for specific applications).
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item we can enumerate all positions that are useful for global plugins
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item using different plugin interface (like hooks)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Configuration will be in arrays below the keys\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{system/elektra/globalplugins}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /prerollback}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /rollback}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /postrollback}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /getresolver}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /pregetcache}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /pregetstorage}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /getstorage}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /postgetstorage}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /postgetcache}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /setresolver}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /presetstorage}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /setstorage}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /precommit}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /commit}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             /postcommit}
\end{DoxyCode}


Additionally, below every of these position following subpositions exist\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{/init}
\DoxyCodeLine{/deinit}
\DoxyCodeLine{/foreach}
\end{DoxyCode}


With different semantics each\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily init} is always paired with {\ttfamily deinit} and can be used for locking purposes. It is guaranteed that {\ttfamily deinit} will be called, if {\ttfamily init} was called before.
\item {\ttfamily foreach} will be called for every single mount point.
\item {\ttfamily max once} (without any subposition) will be called maximum once per {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga28e385fd9cb7ccfe0b2f1ed2f62453a1}{kdb\+Get()}}/kdb\+Set()} outside the loop. It must be called after {\ttfamily init}, and before {\ttfamily deinit}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If a global plugin returns\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/1}\+: {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga28e385fd9cb7ccfe0b2f1ed2f62453a1}{kdb\+Get()}}/kdb\+Set()} will return with an error
\item {\ttfamily 0}\+: {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga28e385fd9cb7ccfe0b2f1ed2f62453a1}{kdb\+Get()}}/kdb\+Set()} will be aborted without an error (except {\ttfamily deinit} and {\ttfamily rollback} plugins are executed)
\item {\ttfamily 1}\+: {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga28e385fd9cb7ccfe0b2f1ed2f62453a1}{kdb\+Get()}}/kdb\+Set()} will continue as if no hook was executed
\end{DoxyItemize}

So that plugins know in which position they currently are, the name of the position will be written as string in parentkey (not starting with slash to distinguish with file names).

Exception\+: {\ttfamily foreach} plugins only get filenames, so to know in which foreach loop you are, you need to add additional {\ttfamily once} placements to correctly track your state.

Next to positioning information plugins have to state in their contract that they will work as global plugin, i.\+e. do not need to work on individual config files, when following contract is present\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{infos/status global}
\end{DoxyCode}


If you need a global plugin for your application {\ttfamily kdb\+Add\+Global\+Plugin} from libtools can be used. If the global plugin is already present, it should be a N\+OP. For this functionality \#684 is needed.

Use cases\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item internal notification within program
\item if applications depend on a global plugin to be present, e.\+g. \#689
\end{DoxyItemize}

Some nice features that will be implemented as global plugins.

Transformation keys which are read and transformed to be usable by the application\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[dir/a]}
\DoxyCodeLine{transform=/x}
\DoxyCodeLine{transform/python=...upper()}
\DoxyCodeLine{         /lua=..}
\end{DoxyCode}


(actually two plugins are involved\+: one that fetches transformation keys, the other that executes the transformation code)


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item preget\+: fetch all foreign keys (kdb\+Get)
\item postget\+: run transformation for all foreign keys
\end{DoxyItemize}

simplifies threading and process locking by not having to think about recursive cases.

Now called {\ttfamily semlock}-\/plugin.

Run shell code at end of all plugins, e.\+g. especially doing


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git add}
\DoxyCodeLine{git commit}
\end{DoxyCode}


The globbing would be more natural (derived from specification). Or even more advanced ways to copy information from specification to the keys, e.\+g. type inference

Now called {\ttfamily spec}-\/plugin.

It should be possible to write plugins which need all file names of all resolver plugins. E.\+g. journalling, global mmap.

For mmap it could work the following way\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{getresolver/after/foreach}
\end{DoxyCode}


is responsible to check if all files resolved are still the same file (and same number of files), and if the {\ttfamily mtime} of the mmap file is newer than the resolved file. Iff this is the case for every mount point we will (try) to load the mmaped file in\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{getresolver/after/once}
\end{DoxyCode}


The loading of the mmap might fail\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item some checksums missing/wrong (file was tampered with)
\item endianness different
\item size of types different
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the loading failed, we will continue by returning 1, if the loading was successful we prematurely abort {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} by returning 0.

If we continued with {\ttfamily kdb\+Get} we want to persist the Key\+Set for the next {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{group__kdb_ga28e385fd9cb7ccfe0b2f1ed2f62453a1}{kdb\+Get()}}} with the same parameters using the global hook\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{getresolver/after/once}
\end{DoxyCode}


Its useful to have some important global plugins, e.\+g. locking by default. See \#690.

Internal list to be used when no system/elektra/global\+\_\+mountpoints/ exists.

State diagrams of plugins need to be redrawn to also include global plugin states.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item How to test global plugins? (Test plugin that mounts itself on every position and checks if it is called correctly?)
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item add {\ttfamily Plugin $\ast$global\+Plugins \mbox{[}N\+R\+\_\+\+O\+F\+\_\+\+P\+L\+U\+G\+I\+NS\mbox{]}} to {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+K\+DB}
\item during {\ttfamily kdb\+Open}, {\ttfamily system/elektra/globalplugins/} is read and plugins are constructed and placed into {\ttfamily global\+Plugins}.
\item In kdb\+Get and kdb\+Set hooks execute one of these plugins
\item by default
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the plugins are all the same {\ttfamily list} plugins, and their subplugins are executed, when {\ttfamily system/elektra/globalplugins/\+\_\+} states they should be executed
\item a {\ttfamily lock} plugin that executes at begin and end of kdb\+Get and kdb\+Set, respective, i.\+e. postrollback preget postget preset postcommit
\item the {\ttfamily lock} plugin contains the code currently found in resolver 
\end{DoxyItemize}
