The {\ttfamily @PLUGIN\+\_\+\+SHORT\+\_\+\+NAME@} handles operating system dependent tasks. One task is the resolving of the filenames for user and system (hence its name).

Use following command to see to which file is resolved to\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{kdb file <Elektra path you are interested in>}

\end{DoxyCode}


See the constants of this plugin for further information, they are\+:

\end{DoxyCode}


The built-\/in resolving considers following cases\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item for spec with absolute path\+: path
\item for spec with relative path\+: {\ttfamily KDB\+\_\+\+DB\+\_\+\+SPEC} + path
\item for dir with absolute path\+: {\ttfamily pwd} + path (or above when path is found)
\item for dir with relative path\+: {\ttfamily pwd} + {\ttfamily KDB\+\_\+\+DB\+\_\+\+DIR} + path (or above when path is found)
\item for user with absolute path\+: {\ttfamily $\sim$} + path
\item for user with relative path\+: {\ttfamily $\sim$} + {\ttfamily KDB\+\_\+\+DB\+\_\+\+USER} + path
\item for system with absolute path\+: path
\item for system with relative path\+: {\ttfamily KDB\+\_\+\+DB\+\_\+\+SYSTEM} + path
\end{DoxyItemize}

($\sim$ and {\ttfamily pwd} are resolved from system)\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md463}{}\doxysection{Example}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md463}
For an absolute path {\ttfamily /example.ini}, you might get following values\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item for spec\+: {\ttfamily /example.ini}
\item for dir\+: {\ttfamily \$\+PWD/example.ini}
\item for user\+: {\ttfamily $\sim$/example.ini}
\item for system\+: {\ttfamily /example.ini}
\end{DoxyItemize}

For an relative path example.\+ini, you might get following values\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item for spec\+: {\ttfamily /usr/share/elektra/specification/example.ini}
\item for dir\+: {\ttfamily \$\+PWD/.dir/example.\+ini}
\item for user\+: {\ttfamily $\sim$/.config/example.\+ini}
\item for system\+: {\ttfamily /etc/kdb/example.ini}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Many variants exist that additionally influence the resolving process, typically by using environment variables.

Environment variables are very simple for one-\/time usage but their maintenance in start-\/up scripts is problematic. Additionally, they are controlled by the user, so they cannot be trusted. So it is not recommended to use environment variables.

Note that the file permissions apply, so it might be possible for non-\/root to modify keys in {\ttfamily system}.

See \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_COMPILE_md}{COMPILE.md}} for a documentation of possible variants.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md465}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md465}
See \mbox{\hyperlink{doc_INSTALL_md}{installation}}. The default variant of this plugin {\ttfamily resolver\+\_\+fm\+\_\+hpu\+\_\+b} is part of the {\ttfamily libelektra5} package. All other variants are part of the {\ttfamily libelektra5-\/extra} package.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md466}{}\doxysubsection{XDG Compatibility}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md466}
The resolver is fully \href{http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html}{\texttt{ XDG compatible}} if configured with the variant\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily xp}, {\ttfamily xh} or {\ttfamily xu} for user (either using {\ttfamily passwd}, {\ttfamily HOME} or {\ttfamily USER} as fallback or any combination of these fallbacks)
\item {\ttfamily x} for system, no fallback necessary
\end{DoxyItemize}

Additionally {\ttfamily KDB\+\_\+\+DB\+\_\+\+USER} needs to be left unchanged as {\ttfamily .config}.

{\ttfamily XDG\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DIRS} will be used to resolve system paths the following way\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item if unset or empty {\ttfamily /etc/xdg} will be used instead
\item all elements are searched in order of importance
\item if a file was found, the search process is stopped
\item if no file was found, the least important element will be used for potential write attempts.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md467}{}\doxysection{Reading Configuration}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md467}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If no update needed (unchanged modification time)\+: quit successfully
\item Otherwise call (storage) plugin(s) to read configuration
\item remember the last stat time (last update)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md468}{}\doxysection{Writing Configuration}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md468}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item On unchanged configuration\+: quit successfully
\item On empty configuration\+: remove the configuration file and quit successfully
\item Otherwise, open the configuration file If not available recursively create directories and retry.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\#ifdef ELEKTRA\+\_\+\+LOCK\+\_\+\+MUTEX


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Try to lock a global mutex, if not possible -\/$>$ conflict
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\#endif

\#ifdef ELEKTRA\+\_\+\+LOCK\+\_\+\+FILE


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Try to lock the configuration file, if not possible -\/$>$ conflict
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\#endif


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Check the update time -\/$>$ might lead to conflict
\item Update the update time (in order to not self-\/conflict)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

We have an optimistic approach. Locking is only used to detect concurrent cooperative processes in the short moment between prepare and commit. A conflict will be raised in that situation. When processes do not lock the file it might be overwritten. This is, however, very unlikely on file systems with nanosecond precision.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md469}{}\doxysection{Exported Functions and Data}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md469}
The resolver provides 2 functions for other plugins to use.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md470}{}\doxysubsection{filename}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md470}
resolves {\ttfamily path} in with namespace {\ttfamily namespace}, creates a temporary file to work on and returns a struct containing the resolved data.

Signature\+: {\ttfamily Elektra\+Resolved $\ast$ filename (elektra\+Namespace namespace, const char $\ast$ path, Elektra\+Resolve\+Tempfile temp\+File, Key $\ast$ warnings\+Key)}

{\ttfamily Elektra\+Resolved} and {\ttfamily Elektra\+Resolve\+Tempfile} are both defined in \href{/home/jenkins/workspace/libelektra-release/src/plugins/resolver/shared.h}{\texttt{ shared.\+h}}.

{\ttfamily Elektra\+Resolved} is a struct with the following members\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily rel\+Path}\+: contains the path relative to the namespace.
\item {\ttfamily dirname}\+: contains the parent directory of the resolved file.
\item {\ttfamily full\+Path}\+: contains the full path of the resolved file.
\item {\ttfamily tmp\+File}\+: contains the full path of the created temporary file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily Elektra\+Resolve\+Tempfile} dictates if and where a temporary file should be created. Possible values\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily ELEKTRA\+\_\+\+RESOLVER\+\_\+\+TEMPFILE\+\_\+\+NONE}\+: don\textquotesingle{}t create a temporary file.
\item {\ttfamily ELEKTRA\+\_\+\+RESOLVER\+\_\+\+TEMPFILE\+\_\+\+SAMEDIR}\+: create a temporary file in the same directory as the resolved file.
\item {\ttfamily ELEKTRA\+\_\+\+RESOLVER\+\_\+\+TEMPFILE\+\_\+\+TMPDIR}\+: create a temporary file in {\ttfamily /tmp}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md471}{}\doxysubsection{free\+Handle}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md471}
frees the handle returned by {\ttfamily filename}.

Signature\+: {\ttfamily void $\ast$ free\+Handle (Elektra\+Resolved $\ast$ handle)}

where {\ttfamily handle} is the handle returned by {\ttfamily filename}.\hypertarget{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md472}{}\doxysection{Limitations}\label{md_src_plugins_resolver_README_autotoc_md472}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If none of the resolving techniques work, the resolver will fail during {\ttfamily kdb\+Open}. This happens, for example, with the default resolver (ELEKTRA\+\_\+\+VARIANT\+\_\+\+USER {\ttfamily hpu}) if neither\+: {\ttfamily \$\+HOME}, {\ttfamily \$\+USER}, nor any home directory in {\ttfamily /etc/passwd} is set.
\item Conflicts with removed files are not handled.
\item Links are not handled.
\item uid/gid from files are not restored.
